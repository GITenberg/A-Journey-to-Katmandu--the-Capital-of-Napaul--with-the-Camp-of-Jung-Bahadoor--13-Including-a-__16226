<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>The interest which was manifested in the Nepaulese Embassy during
the short residence of Jung Bahadoor in England leads me to hope that
a description of the romantic country and independent Court which he
came to represent, as well as some account of his own previous eventful
career, may not be unacceptable to the English public&mdash;more especially
as no work upon Nepaul has been published in this country, that I am
aware of, since Dr. Hamilton&rsquo;s, which appeared about the year
1819.</p>
<p>Through the kindness and friendship of the Nepaulese Ambassador,
I was enabled to visit Katmandu under most favourable circumstances;
and during the journey thither in his company I had abundant opportunity
of obtaining much interesting information, and of gaining an insight
into the character of the people, and their mode of every-day life,
for which a residence in camp was peculiarly favourable.</p>
<p>In the Terai I was fortunate enough to witness the Nepaulese mode
of elephant-catching, so totally unlike that of any other country, while
the grand scale on which our hunting party was organised was equally
novel.</p>
<p>I therefore venture to submit this volume to the public, in the hope
that the novelty of a portion of the matter contained in it will in
some degree compensate for its manifold defects.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<p><i>Arrival of Jung Bahadoor in Ceylon&mdash;Voyage to Calcutta&mdash;Rifle
practice on board the</i> Atalanta&mdash;<i>Rifle-shooting&mdash;Colonel
Dhere Shum Shere&mdash;A journey along the Grand Trunk Road of Bengal&mdash;The
experimental railway&mdash;The explosion at Benares</i>.</p>
<p>Towards the close of the year 1850 a considerable sensation was created
in the usually quiet town of Colombo by the arrival in Ceylon of His
Excellency General Jung Bahadoor, the Nepaulese Ambassador, on his return
to Nepaul, bearing the letter of the Queen of England to the Rajah of
that country.</p>
<p>The accounts which had preceded him of the magnificence of the jewels
with which his person was generally adorned, had raised expectations
amongst the natives which were doomed to disappointment: intelligence
had been received by Jung of the death of the Queen of Nepaul, and the
whole Embassy was in deep mourning, so that their appearance on landing
created no little astonishment, clad, as they all were, in spotless
white, excepting their shoes, which were of black cloth&mdash;leather
not being allowed to form part of the Nepaulese mourning costume.</p>
<p>His Excellency had a careworn expression of countenance, which might
have been caused either by the dissipation attendant upon the gaieties
of his visit to London, by grief for his deceased Queen, or by sea-sickness
during his recent stormy passage across the Gulf of Manaar.&nbsp; He
had been visiting sundry Hindoo shrines, and it was for the purpose
of worshipping at the temple of Ramiseram, which is situate on the island
of that name, in the Gulf of Manaar, forming part of Adam&rsquo;s Bridge,
that he touched at Colombo.&nbsp; Here I was fortunate enough to make
his acquaintance, and, attracted by his glowing description of sport
in Nepaul, accepted an invitation to accompany him to that country,
in order to judge of it for myself.</p>
<p>So good an opportunity is indeed rarely afforded to a European of
visiting Nepaul, and of inspecting the internal economy of its semi-barbarous
Court.&nbsp; I soon found that Jung Bahadoor excelled no less as a travelling
companion than he had done as Premier and Ambassador.</p>
<p>As doubts had arisen and some misapprehension had prevailed in England
as to his position in his own country, I was anxious to ascertain what
was his real rank and how he would be received there.&nbsp; It was reported
that he had risked his temporal welfare by quitting his country, while,
in order that his eternal welfare should in no way be compromised by
this bold and novel proceeding, he had obtained an express reservation
to be made in his favour at Benares, overcoming, by means of considerable
presents, the scruples of a rapacious and not very conscientious priesthood.</p>
<p>The ostensible object of the mission had reference, as far as I could
learn, to a portion of the Terai (a district lying upon the northern
frontier of British India) which formerly belonged to Nepaul, and which
was annexed by the Indian Government after the war of 1815-16; but it
is probable that other motives than any so purely patriotic actuated
the Prime Minister.&nbsp; His observant and inquiring mind had long
regarded the British power in India with wonder and admiration&mdash;sentiments
almost unknown amongst the apathetic Orientals, who, for the most part,
have become too much accustomed to the English to look upon them with
the same feelings as are entertained towards them by the hardy and almost
savage race inhabiting the wild valleys of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>But besides the wish to gratify his curiosity, there existed yet
another incentive which induced him to undertake this expedition.&nbsp;
The precarious nature of his high position in Nepaul urged on him the
good policy, if not the necessity, of a visit to England, for he doubtless
felt, and with good reason, that the Native Durbar would be inclined
to respect a man who had been honoured with an interview with the Queen
of so mighty a nation, and had had opportunities of securing the support
of her government, should he ever be driven to seek its aid.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The <i>Atalanta</i>, one of the oldest steam frigates in the Indian
navy, had been placed at the disposal of His Excellency, and, upon the
evening of the 9th of December 1850, was lying in the Colombo Roads,
getting up her steam as speedily as possible, while I was uneasily perambulating
the wooden jetty, which is all the little harbour can boast in the shape
of a pier, endeavouring to induce some apathetic boatmen to row me over
the bar, a pull of three miles, against a stiff breeze.&nbsp; It was
bright moonlight, and the fire from the funnel of the old ship seemed
rushing out more fast and furious in proportion as the boatmen became
more drowsy and immovable; finally they protested that it was an unheard-of
proceeding for anybody to wish to go on board ship on such a night at
such an hour, and insinuated that all verbal or pecuniary persuasions
would be alike unavailing.&nbsp; It is very evident that Colombo boatmen
are a thriving community; still they seem a timid race, for upon my
having recourse to threats containing fearful allusions, which there
was not the remotest possibility of my being able to carry into execution,
a wonderful revolution was effected in the feelings of the sleepers
around me; they forthwith began to unwind themselves from the linen
wrappers in which natives always swathe themselves at night like so
many hydropathic patients, and, converting their recent sheets into
turbans and waistcloths, they got with many grumblings into a tub-like
boat, just as the smoke from the steamer was becoming ominously black.&nbsp;
Their eyes once open, the men went to work in good earnest, and an hour
afterwards I had the satisfaction of walking the deck of the <i>Atalanta</i>,
which was going at her utmost speed, some seven knots an hour.</p>
<p>In the morning we were off Point de Galle, and put in there for General
Jung Bahadoor, who, with some of his suite, had made the journey thither
by land.</p>
<p>All the world make voyages now-a-days; and nobody thinks of describing
a voyage to India any more than he would an excursion on the Thames,
unless he is shipwrecked, or the vessel he is in is burnt and he escapes
in an open boat, or has some such exciting incident to relate.&nbsp;
We were <i>unfortunate</i> in these respects, but in our passengers
we found much to interest and amuse us; and as everything regarding
the Nepaulese Ambassador is received with interest in England, a description
of the proceedings of one day, as a sample of the ten we spent on board
the <i>Atalanta</i>, may not be altogether uninteresting.</p>
<p>Time never seemed to hang heavy on the hands of the Minister Sahib,
for that was his more ordinary appellation; rifle practice was a daily
occupation with him, and usually lasted two hours.&nbsp; Surrounded
by those of his suite in whose peculiar department was the charge of
the magnificent battery he had on board, he used to take up his station
on the poop, and the crack of the rifle was almost invariably followed
by an exclamation of delight from some of his attendants, as the bottle,
bobbing far astern, was sunk for ever, or the three strung, one below
the other, from the end of the fore-yard-arm, were shattered by three
successive bullets in almost the same number of seconds.&nbsp; Pistol
practice succeeded that of the rifle, and the ace of hearts at 15 paces
was a mark he rarely missed.</p>
<p>Then the dogs were to be trained, and in a very peculiar manner;
a kid was dragged along the deck before the noses of two handsome stag
hounds, who, little suspecting that a huge hunting-whip was concealed
in the folds of their master&rsquo;s dress, were unable to resist so
tempting a victim and invariably made a rush upon it, a proceeding which
brought down upon them the heavy thong of the Minister Sahib&rsquo;s
whip in the most remorseless manner.&nbsp; That task accomplished to
his satisfaction, and not being able to think of anything else wherewith
to amuse himself, it would occur to him that his horse, having thrown
out a splint from standing so long, ought to be physicked.&nbsp; He
was accordingly made to swallow a quantity of raw brandy!&nbsp; It was
useless to suggest any other mode of treatment, either of horse or dogs.&nbsp;
The General laughed at my ignorance, and challenged me to a game of
backgammon.&nbsp; Occasionally gymnastics or jumping were the order
of the day, and he was so lithe and active that few could compete with
him at either.</p>
<p>While smoking his evening pipe he used to talk with delight of his
visit to Europe, looking back with regret on the gaieties of the English
and French capitals, and recounting with admiration the wonders of civilization
he had seen in those cities.&nbsp; He was loudest in his praise of England.&nbsp;
This may have arisen from a wish to gratify his auditory, and it certainly
had that effect.&nbsp; He had not thought it necessary, however, to
perfect himself in the language of either country beyond a few of what
he considered the more important phrases.&nbsp; His stock consisted
chiefly of&mdash;How do you do?&mdash;Very well, thank you&mdash;Will
you sit down?&mdash;You are very pretty&mdash;which pithy sentences
he used to rattle out with great volubility, fortunately not making
an indiscriminate use of them.</p>
<p>But my particular friend was the youngest of his two fat brothers,
whose merits, alas! were unknown in England, the more elevated position
of the Minister Sahib monopolizing all the attention of the lion-loving
public.&nbsp; Colonel Dhere Shum Shere, such was his name, was the most
jovial, light-hearted, and thoroughly unselfish being imaginable, brave
as a lion, as recent events in Nepaul have proved, always anxious to
please, and full of amusing conversation, which, however, from my limited
knowledge of Hindostanee, I was unable fully to appreciate.</p>
<p>It is considered a breach of hospitality to make invidious remarks
affecting the character of the mansion in which you are a guest; but
although my recollections of the <i>Atalanta</i> are most agreeable
in reference to the kindness of the officers, I must say she was a most
indisputable tub; and if there is an individual who deserves to be turned
slowly before the fire in her engine-room, so as to be kept in a state
of perpetual blister, it is the Parsee contractor who furnished the
provisions, for so meagre was the supply that we could barely satisfy
the cravings of hunger.</p>
<p>On the morning of the tenth day after leaving Ceylon we came in sight
of the city of palaces, and, sweeping up its magnificent river, soon
after anchored amidst a host of other shipping.</p>
<p>Of Calcutta I need say nothing; Chouringhee Road is almost as well
known in these days of quick communication as Piccadilly; this is not
quite the case with towns in the interior: if it is easy to get to Calcutta,
it is not so easy to get beyond, and the means of locomotion by which
the traveller makes the journey to Benares are of the most original
nature.</p>
<p>The morning of New Year&rsquo;s Day found me comfortably ensconced
in a roomy carriage, built almost upon the model of an English stage-coach,
in which, with my fellow-traveller, I had passed the night, and which
was being dragged along at the rate of about four miles an hour by ten
coolies, harnessed to it in what the well-meaning philanthropist of
Exeter Hall would call a most barbarous way.</p>
<p>The road along which we were travelling in this extraordinary manner
was not, as might be expected, impassable for horses; on the contrary,
it was an excellent macadamized and perfectly level road, denominated
the Great Trunk Road of Bengal.</p>
<p>The country through which this road led us was flat, stale, but not
unprofitable, since on either side were paddy-fields extending <i>ad
infinitum</i>, studded here and there with clumps of palms.</p>
<p>The climate was delightful, and the morning air tempted us to uncoil
ourselves from our night-wrappers, and take a brisk walk in the dust;
after which we mounted the coach-box, and devised sundry practical methods
for accelerating our team, who however were equally ingenious in contriving
to save themselves fatigue.</p>
<p>The mid-day sun at last ridded them of their tormentors, and we once
more betook ourselves to our comfortable beds in the interior of the
conveyance, there to moralize over the barbarism of a man, calling himself
an enlightened Englishman, in employing men instead of horses to drag
along two of his fellow-countrymen, who showed themselves even more
dead to every feeling of humanity by the way in which they urged on
their unfortunate fellow-creatures.&nbsp; These coolies were certainly
very well paid, and need not have been so employed had they not chosen&mdash;for
they had all applied for their several appointments&mdash;but then the
ignominy of the thing!</p>
<p>And so we rolled lazily along, hoping to reach Benares some time
within the next fortnight.&nbsp; Before dark we passed through Burdwan,
where a few Bengal civilians vegetate on large salaries, to do the work
of the rajah, who is still more highly paid not to interfere.&nbsp;
He lives magnificently in his palace, and they live magnificently in
theirs.&nbsp; We arrived at a small rest-house at night, where we had
the satisfaction of eating a fowl in cutlets an hour after it had been
enjoying the sweets of life.</p>
<p>There is a considerable amount of enjoyment in suddenly coming to
hills after you have for a long time seen nothing but flat country&mdash;in
first toiling up one and then bowling down the other side, at the imminent
peril of the coolies&rsquo; necks&mdash;in seeing streams when you have
seen nothing but wells&mdash;in coming amidst wood and water and diversified
scenery, when every mile that you have travelled for a week past has
been the same as the last.&nbsp; Such were our feelings as we woke at
daylight one morning in the midst of the Rajmahal hills.</p>
<p>There were a good many carts passing with coal from the Burdwan coal-mines;
moreover, we saw sticks, and from the top of each fluttered a little
white flag, suggestive of a railway, whereby our present mode of conveyance
would be knocked on the head, and all the poor coolies who were pushing
us along would be put out of employ.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the disastrous
results which must accrue, a railway is really contemplated; but I have
heard doubts thrown out as to the present line being the best that could
be obtained.&nbsp; It is urged that it has to contend against water
carriage&mdash;that, with the exception of the Burdwan mines, the coal
of which is of an inferior quality, there is no mineral produce&mdash;that
immense tracts of country through which it passes are totally uncultivated,
and from a want of water will in all probability remain so&mdash;and
it has been calculated that, even if the whole traffic at present passing
along the great trunk road of Bengal was to become quadrupled, and if
all the Bengal civilians were to travel up and down every day, and various
rajahs to take express trains once a week, it would not pay: all these
things being considered, were it not that its merits and demerits have
been maturely considered by wiser, or at least better-informed men than
the passing travellers, one might have been inclined to think that those
who expressed doubts regarding its success had some good foundation
for them.</p>
<p>However, it is better to have a railway on a doubtful line than none
at all; the shareholders are guaranteed 5 per cent., and the Government
is rich and can afford to pay them.&nbsp; So let us wish success to
the experimental railway, and hope that the means of transport may soon
be more expeditious than they are at present.</p>
<p>It will doubtless open out the resources of the country, though I
cannot but think, for many reasons, that it would have been more judicious
to have made the line from Allahabad to Delhi the commencement of the
railway system in this part of India, instead of leaving it for a continuation
of the line that is now being made.</p>
<p>The bridges we passed over are all on the suspension principle, and
do credit to the government; the rivers are difficult to bridge in any
other way, as the rains flood them to such an extent that arches will
not remain standing for any length of time.&nbsp; It took us two hours
to cross the Soan, which we forded or ferried according as the streams
between the sand-banks were deep or shallow.&nbsp; This large river
is at times flooded to so great an extent that it is one of the most
serious obstructions to the railway.</p>
<p>It was not until the morning of the seventh day after leaving Calcutta
that we found ourselves on the banks of the Ganges.&nbsp; The Holy City
loomed large in the grey dawn of morning, with its tapering minarets
barely discernible above it, looking like elongated ghosts.</p>
<p>We were ferried across in a boat of antique construction, better
suited for any other purpose than the one to which it was applied, and
landed in the midst of the ruins caused by the dreadful explosion of
gun-powder that had taken place the previous year: it had occasioned
a fearful destruction of property and loss of life, and many hairbreadth
escapes were recounted to us.&nbsp; We were told, indeed, that two children,
after being buried for five days, were dug out alive; two officers were
blown out of the window of an hotel, one of whom was uninjured, the
other was only wounded by a splinter, whilst the Kitmutgar, who was
drawing a cork close to them at the time, was killed on the spot.</p>
<p>In the course of an hour after leaving this scene of desolation we
reached the hospitable mansion which was destined to be our home during
our short stay in Benares.</p>

Bisheshwan Temple, and Maido Rai Minar&mdash;Jung Bahadoor in Benares&mdash;A
Rajah&rsquo;s visit&mdash;The marriage of Jung Bahadoor&mdash;Review

<p>Whatever may be said of the large salaries of the Bengal civilians,
they certainly deserve great credit for the praiseworthy employment
of their wealth; and making amends as it were for the backwardness of
India as regards hotels, they supply their places to the friendless
traveller, in a way which our frigid friends at home might imitate with
advantage.&nbsp; I look back upon my stay in Benares with the greatest
pleasure, and shall long remember the kindness I there experienced.</p>
<p>There is much to be seen in the Holy City, and the means of locomotion
which I should recommend the sight-seer to adopt are Tom Johns, or chairs
swung upon poles, with or without hoods, as the case may be.&nbsp; Upon
arriving at the Chouk or Market-place, we hired two of these conveyances
and started to see the residence of Cashmere Mull.&nbsp; But first I
must make an attempt, however unsuccessful, to describe the Chouk: it
is a large square, studded with raised oblong platforms without walls,
the roofs being supported by fluted Ionic columns.&nbsp; The Police
Court, in which a Native magistrate presides, forms one side of the
square.&nbsp; On the platforms sit the vendors of shawls, skull-caps,
toys, shells, sugar-cane, and various other commodities; but to enumerate
the extraordinary diversity of goods exposed for sale, or to describe
the Babel of tongues which confound the visitor as he wanders through
the motley crowd, would be impossible.</p>
<p>We turned out of the Chouk down a narrow street about three feet
broad, gloomy from the height of the houses, and unpleasant from the
great crowd and close atmosphere; every now and then we got jammed into
a corner by some Brahminee bull, who would insist upon standing across
the street to eat the fine cauliflower he had just plundered from the
stall of an unresisting greengrocer, and who, exercising the proud rights
of citizenship, could only be politely coaxed to move his unwieldy carcase
out of the way.</p>
<p>We wended our way through pipe bazaars and vegetable bazaars, where
each shopkeeper has a sort of stall, with about three feet frontage
to the street, but of unknown depth, and a narrow balcony supported
by carved wood-work over his head, out of the latticed windows of which
bright eyes look down upon the passengers.&nbsp; Whenever there is a
piece of wall not otherwise occupied in this compact and busy city,
you see depicted, in gaudy colours, elephants rushing along with dislocated
joints in hot pursuit of sedate parrots, or brilliant peacocks looking
with calm composure upon camels going express, who must inevitably crush
them in their headlong career, but the vain birds, apparently taken
up with admiration of their own tails, are blind to the impending danger,
thereby reading a good lesson both to the passers-by and to the shopkeepers
opposite.&nbsp; Now a sudden jerk prevents you from further moralizing,
as you find that you are going round a corner so sharp that you must
get bumped either before or behind.&nbsp; There are ugly women carrying
brass water-vessels, rich merchants on ponies, sirwahs on horses, here
and there in the wider streets a camel or an elephant, but very seldom,
as few streets would accommodate either of them; finally there are chuprassies
who disperse the crowd with their swords in a most peremptory manner,
smiting everything indiscriminately, except the Brahminee bulls, which,
although they are much the most serious impediments, are left &ldquo;alone
in their glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the exertions of these city police we reached Cashmere Mull&rsquo;s
house, noted as a specimen of antique Oriental architecture.</p>
<p>The court-yard into which we were first ushered reminded me of an
old English &ldquo;hostelrie;&rdquo; it was small and uncovered, and
round each story ran a curiously worked balcony, on to which opened
doors and windows, carved with strange devices, and all the nooks and
crannies formed by so much intricate carving were filled with dust and
cobwebs.&nbsp; Passing up a narrow, dark, and steep stone stair, we
reached a second court-yard, upon the balcony of which we emerged, and
which was so very like the last, that I imagined it to be the same,
until I remarked that it was smaller, and, if possible, more dirty.&nbsp;
We thence ascended to the flat roof of the house, and on our way looked
through half-open doors into dark dungeons of rooms, which one would
not for the world have ventured into at night.</p>
<p>There was a raised stage with steps up to it, which we ascended and
found ourselves on a level with a great many similar stages on the tops
of a great many similar houses.&nbsp; A stone parapet about 8 feet high,
with beautiful open carving, enclosed this stage, so that we could inspect
our neighbours through our stone screen with impunity.&nbsp; On the
next roof to where we were was a boy training pigeons, and the numerous
crates or frames on the surrounding house-tops showed this to be a favourite
amusement.&nbsp; The young gentleman in question certainly made his
flock obey him in a wonderful manner, his chief object being to take
prisoner a pigeon from his neighbour&rsquo;s flock.&nbsp; He directed
their gyrations by loud shrill cries, and, as there were numbers of
other members of &ldquo;Young Benares&rdquo; employed in like manner,
it seemed wonderful how he could recognize his pigeons, or they their
master.</p>
<p>Leaving this antique specimen of a nobleman&rsquo;s town house, we
passed through a maze of narrow streets; and bobbing under low archways
at the imminent peril of fracturing our skulls, we arrived at the Bisheshwan
Temple, which was crowded with Hindoos worshipping the Lingum, representations
of which met the eye in every direction.</p>
<p>A well in the yard behind the temple was surrounded by worshippers
of the god, who is supposed to have plunged down it and never to have
come up again.&nbsp; If so, he must find the smell of decayed vegetation
very oppressive, as garlands of flowers and handfuls of rice are continually
being offered up, or rather down, to him.&nbsp; From this well we had
a good view of the temple, which was covered with gold by Runjeet Singh,
and presents a gorgeous and dazzling appearance.</p>
<p>In close vicinity to this temple is a mosque built by Arungzebe to
annoy the Hindoos.&nbsp; I ascended the Maido Rai Minar or minaret,
and from its giddy height had a magnificent panorama of the city and
its environs, with the Ganges flowing majestically beneath, its left
bank teeming with life, while the opposite bank seemed desolate.</p>
<p>The observatory, or man mundil, is on the river&rsquo;s bank, and
affords a pretty view from its terraces, which are covered with disks
and semicircles and magical figures cut in stone.</p>
<p>Gopenate Dore Peshad is the great dealer in Benares embroidery, as
well as its manufacturer.&nbsp; We paid him a visit and were delighted
with the rich variety of embroidered goods which were displayed; we
saw pieces valued at from 10,000 rupees downwards: magnificent smoking
carpets, housings and trappings for horses, shawls, caps, kenkabs, and
other articles of eastern attire, were spread out before us in gorgeous
profusion.&nbsp; After eating a cardamum, and touching with our pocket-handkerchief
some cotton on which had been dropped otto of roses, we ascended to
the house-top, and found it built upon much the same plan as Cashmere
Mull&rsquo;s, without its antique carving and quaint appearance.</p>
<p>We were not a little glad when the bustle and heat attendant on so
much sight-seeing was over, and we forced our way back through the crowded
streets.</p>
<p>The population of Benares is estimated by Mr. Prinsep at nearly 200,000;
its trade consists chiefly in sugar, saltpetre, indigo, opium, and embroidered
cloths; besides which, the city has advantages in its position on the
great river, making it, jointly with Mirzapore, the dep&ocirc;t for
the commerce of the Dukkum and interior of Hindostan.</p>
<p>General Jung Bahadoor had reached Benares a few days before I arrived
there, and I found him installed in a handsome house, the envy of all
rajahs, the wonder of the natives, and the admiration of his own countrymen,
some thousands of whom had come thus far to meet him.&nbsp; If he had
been a lion in London, he was not less an object of interest at Benares&mdash;his
house was always crowded with visitors of high degree, Indian and European;
one old native rajah in particular was frequently to be seen in close
conference with him; and the result was, that the Prime Minister of
Nepaul became the husband of the second daughter of his Highness the
ex-Rajah of Coorg.&nbsp; Upon the day following his nuptials my friend
and I called upon him, and to our surprise he offered to present us
to his newly wedded bride.&nbsp; We, of course, expressed our sense
of the honour he was doing us; and had just reached the balcony, the
stairs leading up to which were on the outside of the house, when our
friend the bridegroom perceived his father-in-law, the Coorg rajah,
coming in a most dignified manner down the approach.&nbsp; Like a schoolboy
caught in the master&rsquo;s orchard, he at once retreated and unceremoniously
hurried us back&mdash;and just in time, for no doubt, if the old Coorg
had detected him thus exhibiting his daughter the day after he had married
her, he would have mightily disapproved of so improper a proceeding.&nbsp;
This incident shows how utterly Jung despised those prejudices which
enthralled his bigoted father-in-law.&nbsp; He was, in fact, the most
European Oriental, if I may so speak, that I ever met with, and more
thoroughly unaffected and unreserved in his communication with us than
is the habit with eastern great men, who always seem afraid of compromising
themselves by too much condescension.&nbsp; An instance of this occurred
during another visit.&nbsp; While we were chatting on indifferent subjects
a native rajah was announced, as being desirous of paying a visit of
ceremony.&nbsp; Jung immediately stepped forward to receive him with
much politeness.&nbsp; The rajah commenced apologising for not having
called sooner, excusing himself on the plea of the present being the
only auspicious hour which had been available since his Excellency&rsquo;s
arrival; a compliment which the latter returned by remarking that it
was unfortunate that his immediate departure would preclude the possibility
of his returning his visit, which he the more regretted, as he was at
present most particularly engaged in matters of a pressing nature with
the English gentlemen, and he therefore hoped he would be excused thus
abruptly, but unavoidably, terminating an interview which it would otherwise
have given him the greatest pleasure to have prolonged.&nbsp; Thus saying,
he politely rose and led the rajah in the most graceful manner to the
front door, which was no sooner closed behind him than he returned,
rubbing his hands with great glee, as he knowingly remarked, &ldquo;That
is the way to get over an interview with one of these natives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A detachment of a regiment had come to Benares to escort the General
on his journey to Katmandu, and he accordingly determined to favour
the inhabitants generally, and the English in particular, with a review.</p>
<p>The men were tall and well-made, and were dressed in a light-green
uniform with yellow facings.&nbsp; They went through various evolutions
with tolerable regularity; but the performance which excited the most
interest was the platoon exercise, no word of command being given, but
everything done with the utmost precision at different notes of the
music, the men beating time the whole while and giving a swaying motion
to their bodies, which produced a most curious effect.&nbsp; The origin
of this novel proceeding, his Excellency told us, was a request by the
Ranee that some other means should be invented of putting the men through
their exercises than by hoarse shouts, which grated upon her ear.&nbsp;
The minister immediately substituted this more euphonious but less business-like
method.</p>
<p>At this review Jung Bahadoor and his brothers were dressed in the
costume they wore when in England: the handsome diamonds in their turbans
glittering in the sunshine.</p>
<p>I accompanied him one day on a visit to the Benares college, a handsome
building in process of erection by the Indian Government.&nbsp; The
Gothic and Oriental styles of architecture are most happily combined,
and there is an airiness about the building; but this did not in any
way detract from its solidity.&nbsp; The cost of the college and professor&rsquo;s
house is not to exceed 13,000 pounds; the length of the large school-room
is 260 feet, its breadth 35; and there are six large class-rooms on
each side.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p><i>Jaunpore&mdash;A shooting-party&mdash;Scenes in camp and on the
march&mdash;A Nepaulese dinner&mdash;Ghazipore&mdash;The Company&rsquo;s
stud&mdash;Indian roads&mdash;Passage of the Gograh&mdash;Jung Bahadoor&rsquo;s
mode of despatching an alligator</i>.</p>
<p>Being anxious to visit Jaunpore, I left Benares one evening after
dinner, and accomplished the distance, 36 miles, with one set of bearers,
in seven hours and a half.</p>
<p>The first object that attracts the eye of the traveller as he enters
Jaunpore is the many-arched bridge thrown by the Mahometans over the
Goomte, and considered the finest built by them in India; on each side
are stalls, in which sit the vendors of various wares, after the fashion
of old London Bridge.&nbsp; On an island in the middle of the river
was discovered a huge figure of a winged lion guarding an elephant,
which would suggest some connexion with the sculptures found at Nineveh,
and must date much further back than the erection of the bridge.</p>
<p>Passing through a serai, which was filled with travellers, we reached
the fort, built, it is supposed, by Khan Kan, or one of the kings of
the Shirkee dynasty, about the year 1260.&nbsp; From one of its turrets
we had a magnificent view of the town and the surrounding country, while
immediately below is seen the river, spanned by the picturesque old
bridge, unmoved by the fierce floods which so constantly destroy those
arched bridges that have been erected in India by Europeans.</p>
<p>The appearance of the town is diminished in size, but increased in
beauty, by the many stately trees which are planted throughout it, while
here and there a huge screen of some musjid rears its Egyptian-looking
crest, and gives to the town an appearance peculiar to itself; Jaunpore
is, in fact, the only city in India in which this style of architecture
prevails.</p>
<p>On our way out of the fort we passed a monolithe, on which was an
inscription in the same character as that on Ferozeshah&rsquo;s Lath
at Delhi, which has been recently translated by Mr. Prinsep.&nbsp; In
the main gateway were some porcelain slabs which had at one time formed
part of a Jain temple.</p>
<p>The Itala musjid, to which we next bent our steps, has been built
on the site of one of these temples; its cloisters remain untouched,
and the figures on almost every slab bear undoubted testimony to the
previous existence of a Jain temple on this spot.&nbsp; The large square
rooms, which were filled during our visit with true believers, were
curiously roofed; a dome was ingeniously thrown over the square.&nbsp;
An octagon, placed on solid buttresses, supported a 16-sided figure,
which in its turn supported the dome.&nbsp; The Jumma musjid, which
we also visited, was remarkable for its magnificent screen, 120 feet
in height by 70 in breadth, and covered with curious inscriptions and
fantastic devices; the top is slightly narrower than the base, tapering
in depth as well as in breadth.</p>
<p>The population of Jaunpore is about 35,000; there is a small European
station near the town.&nbsp; In the course of the evening&rsquo;s drive
I saw a specimen of the Addansonia or baobab-tree: the trunk, measuring
23 feet in circumference, was perfectly smooth and the branches were
destitute of leaves.&nbsp; There are but five other specimens in India,
and not many in Java, where the tree was discovered by Mr. Addanson;
it is said to have attained, in some instances, the enormous age of
2000 years.</p>
<p>Leaving Jaunpore about midnight, I reached the camp of Jung Bahadoor
on the following day.&nbsp; The scene as we approached was in the highest
degree picturesque; 5000 Nepaulese were here collected, followers, in
various capacities, of the Prime Minister, whose tents were pitched
at a little distance from the grove of mango-trees which sheltered his
army and retainers.&nbsp; On our arrival he was out shooting, so, mounting
an elephant, we proceeded to join him.&nbsp; We heard such frequent
reports of fire-arms that we fully expected to find excellent sport;
great was my disappointment, therefore, when I saw him surrounded by
some 20 or 30 followers, who held umbrellas, loaded his guns, rushed
to pick up the <i>game</i>, or looked on applaudingly while he stealthily
crept up to take a deliberate pot shot at some unlucky parrot or small
bird that might catch his eye as it perched on a branch, or fluttered
unconsciously amongst the leaves.&nbsp; But the most interesting object
in the group was the lately-wedded bride, who was seated in a howdah.&nbsp;
Jung introduced her to me as &ldquo;his beautiful Missis&rdquo;&mdash;a
description she fully deserved.&nbsp; She was very handsome, and reflected
much credit on the taste of the happy bridegroom, who seemed pleased
when we expressed our approval of his choice.</p>
<p>Before quitting the subject of Jung&rsquo;s shooting-party, I must
remark, in justice to him as a sportsman, that he considers nothing
less than a deer to be game at all.&nbsp; Tiger or rhinoceros shooting
is his favourite sport, and he looks upon shooting a parrot, a snipe,
a hawk, or a partridge as being equally unworthy of the name of sport,
nor does he understand why some of those birds should be dignified with
the name of &ldquo;game,&rdquo; and the others not.</p>
<p>At dawn on the following morning the stir and bustle in camp announced
an early start, and our elephant appeared at the tent door just as the
gallant rifle corps marched past, the band playing the &ldquo;British
Grenadiers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mounting the elephant, we picked our way through
the debris of the camp, now almost deserted; some few of the coolies
were still engaged packing the conical baskets which they carry on their
backs, one strap passing over the forehead, and two others over the
shoulders.&nbsp; The appearance of a hill coolie as he thus staggers
along under his tremendous burden is singular enough, and so totally
unlike that of the coolies of the plains, that it was a sort of promise
of there being in store for us more curiosities, both of Nepaulese men
and manners, in their native country, and we looked with no little interest
upon the first specimens we had seen of the Newar race&mdash;the aborigines
of Nepaul.&nbsp; Short and compact, the full development of their muscle
bore evidence to their almost Herculean strength.&nbsp; Their flat noses,
high cheek-bones, small eyes, and copper-coloured complexion are unequivocal
signs of a Mongolian origin, whilst the calves of their legs, which
I never saw equalled in size, indicate the mountainous character of
their country.</p>
<p>Threading our way on our wary elephant through nearly 5000 of these
singular-looking beings, all heavily loaded with the appurtenances of
the camp, we soon overtook the cort&egrave;ge of the Minister and his
brothers, which consisted of three or four carriages dragged along by
coolies, over a road which, in many places, must have severely tried
the carriage springs, as well as nearly dislocated the joints of Jung&rsquo;s
&ldquo;beautiful little Missis,&rdquo; whom I saw peeping out of one
of the windows.&nbsp; The rest of this motley crowd, with which we were
destined to march for the next three weeks, was made up of Nepaul gentlemen
in various capacities, who cantered past on spirited little horses,
or squatted cross-legged in the clumsy, oddly constructed &ldquo;Ecce,&rdquo;
a sort of native gig; besides these, there were merchants and peddlers,
who followed the camp as a matter of speculation.&nbsp; Amidst an indiscriminate
horde, our elephant jogged lazily along, generally surrounded by eight
or ten others, with whom we marched for company&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp;
We usually arrived at the mango tope destined to be our camping-ground
about ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and lounged away the heat of
the day in tents; towards the afternoon Jung generally went out with
his gun or rifle, shooting with the former at parrots at ten yards distance,
and with the latter at bottles at a hundred.&nbsp; There was not much
attraction for the sportsman throughout the whole line of march, and
I only bagged a few couple of snipe, partridges, wild-duck, and quail.</p>
<p>Our dinner was always supplied from Jung&rsquo;s own carpet, for
he does not use a table, and it was with no little curiosity that at
the end of the first day&rsquo;s march I looked forward to the productions
of a Nepaul cuisine.&nbsp; We had not forgotten to provide ourselves
with a sufficient <i>stand-by</i> in case it should not prove altogether
palatable.&nbsp; Towards evening an enormous dish, containing rice enough
to have satisfied the whole of the gallant rifle corps, was brought
into our tent, closely followed by about 20 little cups formed of leaves,
one inside the other, each containing about a thimbleful of some exquisite
condiment; also three or four saucers containing some cold gravy, of
unpleasant colour, in which floated about six minute particles of meat.</p>
<p>Filling my plate with rice, which had been well and carefully greased
to improve its flavour, and scientifically mixing the various other
ingredients therewith, I unhesitatingly launched a spoonful into my
mouth, when I was severely punished for my temerity, and almost overcome
by the detestable compound of tastes and smells that at once assailed
both nose and palate: it was a pungent, sour, bitter, and particularly
greasy mouthful; but what chiefly astonished me, so much as to prevent
my swallowing it for some time, was the perfume of Colonel Dhere Shum
Shere, the fat brother, which I was immediately sensible of, as overpowering
everything else.&nbsp; Not that I would for a moment wish to insinuate
that it was a nasty smell; on the contrary, it would have been delicious
on a pocket-handkerchief; but to imagine it going down one&rsquo;s throat,
in company with an immense amount of grease and gravy, was nearly enough
to prevent its doing so at all.</p>
<p>Our march to Ghazipore was through country richly cultivated and
pleasing, if not absolutely pretty.&nbsp; The numerous poppy-plantations
were evidence of our proximity to the headquarters of one of the largest
opium agencies in India.&nbsp; Ghazipore is approached by an avenue
of handsome trees, more ornamental than useful, seeing how utterly destructive
it is to the permanent welfare of a road.</p>
<p>The mausoleum, containing a monument to Lord Cornwallis, is solid
but not ungraceful: upon one side of the monument are sculptured the
figures of a Hindoo and a Mussulman, and on the other a British and
a native grenadier, all of whom are weeping.&nbsp; The building is prettily
situated near the bank of the Ganges, on a large plain or maidan, across
which pleasant avenues lead in all directions; the one which we followed
brought us to the stables of the Company&rsquo;s stud, containing 700
horses.&nbsp; On our way we remarked a number of handsome houses now
unoccupied and falling rapidly into decay, the military force at the
station having of late been much reduced.&nbsp; The horses were being
exercised, notwithstanding which they carried a good deal of superfluous
fat, and vented their spirits by occasionally breaking loose, and dashing
pell-mell through rings of their companions, who, grudging them the
sweets of liberty, made vigorous efforts to partake of them, and in
some instances succeeded.&nbsp; I saw not less than eight at once dashing
about in the large training enclosure.&nbsp; My friend having already
bought three, we thought it best to withdraw ourselves from further
temptation, and set out to join the camp at Cossimabad, 16 miles distant,
still passing through richly cultivated country, which was as pretty
as a dead level ever can be.</p>
<p>The crops most generally reared are, sugar-cane, poppies, rare (a
species of pulse), wheat, often with a delicate border of blue-flowered
flax, tobacco, mustard, peas, and sometimes vetches.&nbsp; The large
rose-gardens for which Ghazipore is celebrated lay to the right.&nbsp;
I regretted that our way did not lead us through them, but we had evidence
of their existence in some delicious otto of roses, which is easily
procured here.</p>
<p>The road by which we were now travelling was what is called in India
a cutcher-road, which means unmetalled.&nbsp; It is a pity that Government
should spend so much in macadamizing roads, when cutcher-roads answer
just as well for all the wants of native traffic.&nbsp; The rocks here
are of limestone formation, and consequently, as there is not much traffic
on any road in India, if the trees were cut down, roads on a limestone
formation would always keep themselves in repair, provided the side
drains were properly kept open.&nbsp; The bridges are all good, and,
if the line of road was well bridged throughout, the country conveyances
could always make their way along it with perfect ease.&nbsp; If the
money now spent in macadamizing were spent in making the necessary bridges,
the resources of the country would be much more fully opened out than
they are at present; a garre-waller, or cart-man, can always appreciate
a bridge, never a macadamized road.&nbsp; At present the bridges on
this road are all wooden, and liable to be carried away by the first
heavy flood.</p>
<p>The whole way to the frontier of Nepaul we travelled along a cutcher-road,
accompanied by a train of at least a hundred hackerys, without the slightest
inconvenience; and until the style of cart at present used by the natives
becomes wonderfully improved, this road may well be used, except of
course during the rains.</p>
<p>A few days&rsquo; march brought us to the banks of the Gograh, a
large river rising in the western Terai, and measuring, at the point
where we crossed, at least half a mile in breadth.&nbsp; As we came
upon the cliff overlooking the river, the scene was novel and amusing.&nbsp;
As 5000 persons had to reach the opposite bank, and no preparations
had been made for their transit, the confusion may be easily imagined.&nbsp;
The good-humour of the hillmen, however, was imperturbable, and, though
there was plenty of loud talking, the remarks made were usually of a
facetious nature.</p>
<p>The stream was rapid, and carried the boats down some distance.&nbsp;
Ten elephants, with nothing visible but the tips of their trunks and
the crowns of their heads, on which latter squatted the mahouts, made
the passage gallantly.&nbsp; On the opposite side we passed through
a village, the little square of which was absolutely filled with monkeys.&nbsp;
They resort thither by hundreds from the neighbouring jungles to be
fed by the villagers, and are most independent in their behaviour, unscrupulously
attacking the man who brings their daily allowance, and, as they are
accounted sacred, they are of course unmolested.&nbsp; We saw some serious
fights amongst them, young and old mixing indiscriminately in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e;
a mother was frequently seen making a rapid but orderly retreat with
her young one on her back.</p>
<p>We occasionally passed picturesque villages, the inhabitants of which
were of course all attracted by so novel a spectacle.&nbsp; The system
pursued by the villagers here is the same as may be observed in many
parts of the Continent of Europe: they invariably congregate in a collection
of mud-built closely packed huts, showing a gregarious disposition,
and great aversion to living alone.&nbsp; I do not remember to have
passed one solitary house.&nbsp; As the whole of the country is richly
cultivated, the distance of their dwellings from the scene of their
daily labour must in some instances be considerable.</p>
<p>The Gandaki, over which we were ferried, is a large stream rising
in Nepaul, and as broad as the Gograh.&nbsp; We went some distance up
its banks, in the hopes of finding wild-pig, but were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>The minister, however, being determined not to go home empty handed,
doomed to destruction a huge alligator, unconsciously basking on a sand-bank.&nbsp;
Accordingly, arming eight of us with double-barrelled rifles, he marched
us in an orderly manner to the bank, when, at a given signal, 16 balls
whistled through the air, arousing in a most unpleasant manner the monster
from his mid-day slumbers, who plunged into the stream and disappeared
almost instantaneously, and the Minister Sahib, coolly pulling out the
wallet which contained his tiffin, remarked that we might profitably
employ ourselves in that way until he came up to breathe, when he should
receive another dose.&nbsp; Retiring therefore a few yards from me&mdash;for
a Hindoo may not eat in the presence of a Christian&mdash;he and his
brothers were soon deep in the mysteries of curious viands.&nbsp; Perceiving,
however, that I was not prepared for an alfresco luncheon, he shared
with me some grapes, pomegranates, etc., as well as a piece of green-looking
meat, which I found very delightfully scented.&nbsp; As we were in the
middle of our repast, our wounded friend showed his nose above the water,
when he was immediately struck by a splendid shot from the minister,
who was in no way disconcerted by having his mouth full at the time.&nbsp;
Lashing the water furiously with his tail, the alligator once more disappeared:
he came up shortly after, and the same scene was enacted three times
before his huge form floated lifeless down the stream.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p><i>A picnic on the Nepaul frontier&mdash;A boar-hunt&mdash;The Terai
and its resources&mdash;Our shooting quarters&mdash;Incidents of sport&mdash;A
tiger-hunt&mdash;The great elephant exhibition of 1851&mdash;Camp Bechiacor</i>.</p>
<p>Pitched under the shade of some wide-spreading mangoes are a variety
of tents of all sizes, from the handsome and spacious marquee to the
snug sleeping tent; near them are picqueted a number of fine-looking
Arab horses in prime condition, while the large barouche, which is standing
close by, might have just emerged from a coach-house in a London mews;
a few servants are loitering about, and give life to this otherwise
tranquil scene.</p>
<p>Nobody can for an instant suppose that this is the camp of Jung Bahadoor;
his tents are green and red and generally surrounded by soldiers; his
horses do not look so sleek and fresh as these; he has not got a barouche
belonging to him, far less a piano, and I think I hear the music of
one proceeding from yonder large tent.&mdash;No&mdash;this is an Indian
picnic&mdash;none of your scrambling, hurried pleasure parties to last
for a wet day, when everybody brings his own food, and eats it uncomfortably
with his fingers, with some leaves for a plate and an umbrella for a
roof, and then persuades himself and others that he has been enjoying
himself.&nbsp; Let such an one come and make trial of a deliberate,
well-organized picnic of a fortnight&rsquo;s duration, such as the one
now before us, with plenty of sport in the neighbourhood, while the
presence of the fair sex in camp renders the pleasures of the drawing-room
doubly delightful after those of the chace.</p>
<p>Boar-hunting, or, as it is commonly called, pig-sticking, is essentially
an Indian sport, and I could not have partaken of it under more favourable
auspices than I did at Hirsede, when, having obtained intelligence of
a wild boar, and having been supplied with steeds, some five or six
of us proceeded in pursuit of the denizen of the jungles.&nbsp; We soon
roused and pressed him closely through the fields of castor-oil and
rare-cates.&nbsp; The thick stalks of the former often balked our aim.&nbsp;
He received repeated thrusts notwithstanding, and charged three or four
times viciously, slightly wounding my horse, and more severely that
of one of my companions.&nbsp; After being mortally wounded, the brute
unfortunately dodged into a thick jungle, where, hiding himself in the
bushes, he baffled all our efforts to dislodge him.&nbsp; In their attempts
to do so, however, the beaters turned out a fine young boar, who gave
us a splendid run of upwards of a mile at top speed&mdash;for a pig
is a much faster animal than his appearance indicates, and one would
little imagine, as he scuttles along, that he could keep a horse at
full gallop.&nbsp; However, he soon became blown, and, no friendly patch
of jungle being near for him to take refuge in, was quickly despatched,</p>
<p>Our revels having been kept up to a late hour, I left Hirsede in
the small hours of the morning, and came up to Jung Bahadoor&rsquo;s
camp on the Nepaul frontier.</p>
<p>A small stream divides the Company&rsquo;s from the Nepaulese dominions,
and on crossing it the change of government was at once obvious.&nbsp;
The villages looked more wretched, the people more dirty, the country
was almost totally uncultivated, and nearly all traces of roads disappeared
as we traversed the green sward of the Terai of Nepaul, scattered over
which were large herds of cattle, grazing on the short grass, which
extended in all directions over the vast expanse of flat country.</p>
<p>This province is governed by Krishna Bahadoor, a younger brother
of the prime minister, an active and energetic officer.&nbsp; Any complaint
of the peasantry is in the first instance brought to his notice, and
referred by him to his brother, if his decision does not give satisfaction.&nbsp;
His subordinates are a sirdar, or judge, and several subahs, or collectors.</p>
<p>The Terai is a long narrow strip of territory, extending for three
hundred miles along the northern frontier of British India, and is about
twenty miles in breadth.&nbsp; The whole tract is a dead level.&nbsp;
For the first ten miles after crossing the frontier the country is used
chiefly for grazing by the inhabitants of the adjoining British provinces,
who drive thousands of cattle across the border, paying a considerable
revenue to the Nepaul government for the privilege of so doing.</p>
<p>Ten miles from the frontier commences the great saul forest, which
is also ten miles in breadth.&nbsp; It is composed almost entirely of
the valuable saul-tree, and a great quantity of timber is annually exported
to Calcutta down the Gandaki, which is navigable to the foot of the
Cheriagotty hills.&nbsp; The licence to fell the saul timber is confined
exclusively to Nepaul merchants, and the payment demanded by Government
for such permission is so enormous that the trade is not very profitable.</p>
<p>The principal sources of revenue derived from this district are the
land-tax and the receipts from the sale of licences for felling timber
and for grazing cattle.&nbsp; The large amount thus received, together
with the number of elephants which are annually caught in the great
forest, renders the Terai a most valuable appendage to the Nepaul dominions.</p>
<p>It is, however, entirely owing to the excellent management of Jung
that the revenue of the Terai is now so considerable.&nbsp; In 1816
this province did not yield more than one-tenth its present revenue,
which is now computed to amount to fifty lacs (500,000 pounds).&nbsp;
Still the Terai might be made yet more profitable.&nbsp; At present
no use whatever is made of the hides and horns of the hundreds of head
of cattle that die daily in this district, which are left to rot on
the carcases of the beasts.&nbsp; It would remain to be proved however
whether, even if permission were granted by the Nepaul Government, any
would be found possessing the capital or enterprise to engage in a speculation
which would, unquestionably, ensure a handsome return.</p>
<p>It is not, however, in a pecuniary point of view alone that the Terai
is considered by the Nepaulese as contributing to the prosperity of
their dominions; it is looked upon as one of their chief safeguards
against invasion.&nbsp; For nine or ten months a disease, denominated
by the natives the &ldquo;Ayul,&rdquo; renders the Terai impassable
to man, so deadly are its effects even to the natives of the country.&nbsp;
It would appear that might be obviated&mdash;if we are to believe the
native theory somewhat gravely recorded by Mr. Hamilton (who made a
journey through this province with a mission sent by Government in 1803)&mdash;by
going in search of and killing certain serpents, which are said to poison
the atmosphere with their breath.&nbsp; I should be inclined to recommend
the cutting down of the jungle in preference to the cutting up of the
serpents; and I have little doubt that, were parts of the great forest
cleared, and wide roads cut through it, it would cease to be so pestilential
a locality as it is at present.&nbsp; In case of a war, there would
be no difficulty, even now, in our troops possessing themselves of the
whole territory to the foot of the Cheriagotty hills in the cold season;
but as we should have to maintain some position throughout the year,
the top of those hills themselves would be the only one available, and
here, in the heart of an enemy&rsquo;s country, and cut off from all
communication with India, the position of the garrison would be anything
but enviable.</p>
<p>I observed several of the natives of this district afflicted with
go&icirc;tre, and I was informed that cretinism was also prevalent,&mdash;a
fact which proves clearly the fallacy of the old doctrine that these
complaints are attributable to snow-water, for all the water drunk by
the inhabitants of the Terai rises in the Cheriagotty hills, on which
snow rarely if ever falls.&nbsp; This would be strongly corroborative
of the correctness of the idea that malaria is the origin of go&icirc;tre
and cretinism, even if the experiment which has been tried at Interlacken,
of building a hospital on the hills, above the influence of the infectious
atmosphere in the valley, had not proved completely successful.</p>
<p>The camp which was destined to be our headquarters during a few days&rsquo;
shooting was pitched in the plain near the village of Bisoleah, distant
about two miles from the borders of the grand jungle.&nbsp; Its appearance
was totally different from those already described; two more regiments
were here in attendance upon the Minister; the men were all comfortably
lodged in grass huts got up for the occasion, and the innumerable host
of camp followers, who on the march had been contented with wrapping
themselves up in their thick cloths, and sleeping in groups round the
various fires, were now engaged in erecting like temporary habitations,
forming by these means a grass village of considerable extent.</p>
<p>Horses, oxen, camels, elephants, were tethered in every direction,
or wandering in search of sweeter tufts of grass.&nbsp; The village
itself was close and dirty; the largest house, which stood near a temple,
was occupied by some half-dozen wives of the Minister, who had come
to the borders of their country to welcome home their lord and master.</p>
<p>Our tents were pitched between the camp and a small clump of trees,
near which upwards of 300 elephants were tethered; a stream divided
us from them, the banks of which presented a continual scene of confusion,
as men and animals, at all hours, passed along in crowds, while the
motley groups, collecting as the Minister moved about to inspect various
parts of his establishment, indicated the whereabouts of that great
personage.&nbsp; The scene struck us as particularly novel and attractive
when we arrived from Hirsede about mid-day; as we approached from one
direction, the Minister Sahib arrived from another, mounted in a handsome
howdah, the trophy of the morning being a tiger which he had just killed,
and which was lashed on to the elephant following him, while a hundred
more hustled one another up the steep bank and through the crowded street,
greatly to the inconvenience of his dutiful subjects, who were salaaming
vociferously.</p>
<p>We immediately started in quest of like game, and commenced beating
the heavy jungle, by which the plain was bounded as by a wall, but fortune
did not smile upon our efforts, and we only succeeded in killing a deer
and a pig.&nbsp; I found my first experience in shooting from a howdah
to be anything but agreeable: the deer bounds through the long grass
as a rabbit would through turnips; and, at the moment one catches a
glimpse of his head, the elephant is sure to be going down a steep place,
or stopping or going on suddenly, or trumpeting, or doing something
which completely balks a sportsman accustomed to be on his own legs,
and sends the ball flying in any direction but the right one.&nbsp;
Our line of elephants consisted of upwards of one hundred, and they
beat regularly and silently enough, except when the behaviour of one
of them irritated some passionate mahout, who would vent his wrath upon
the head of the animal by a blow from a short iron rod, or would catch
him sharply under the ear with a huge hook, which he dexterously applied
to a sore kept open for that purpose; then a loud roar of pain would
sound through the jungle for a moment, much to our disgust, as it startled
the deer we were silently and gradually approaching.</p>
<p>The pig, which formed part of the game-bag of the afternoon, was,
in the first instance, only severely wounded, and an elephant was commanded
to finish the poor brute; as he lay, grimly surveying us, his glistening
tusks looked rather formidable,&mdash;so at least the elephant seemed
to think, as for some time he strongly objected to approach him.&nbsp;
At last he went timidly up and gave the boar a severe kick with his
fore-foot, drawing it back quickly with a significant grunt, which plainly
intimated his opinion that he had done as much as could reasonably be
expected of him.&nbsp; His mahout, however, thought otherwise, and,
by dint of severe irritation on the sore behind his ear, seemed to drive
him to desperation, as the elephant suddenly backed upon the pig, and,
getting him between his hind legs, ground them together, and absolutely
broke him up.&nbsp; After this we went crashing home, regardless of
the thick jungle through which we passed, as the impending boughs were
snapped, at the word of the mahouts, by the obedient and sagacious animals
they bestrode.</p>
<p>Daybreak of the 30th of January found us not foot in stirrup, but
foot on ladder, for we were mounting our elephants to proceed in search
of the monarch of the Indian jungles, intelligence of the lair of a
male and female having been brought into camp overnight.&nbsp; A hundred
elephants followed in a line, forming a picturesque procession, towards
the long grass jungle in which our noble game was reported to be ensconced.&nbsp;
On reaching the scene of action we formed into a line and beat regularly
the whole length of the patch.&nbsp; We were not destined to wait long,
and the crack of my friend&rsquo;s rifle soon sounded in my ears.&nbsp;
He had wounded the tiger severely, and the animal had again disappeared
in the long grass.&nbsp; We were now on the alert, as it was impossible
he could escape us; and in a few moments I had the satisfaction of seeing
him bounding through the grass at about thirty yards&rsquo; distance.&nbsp;
The report of my rifle was quickly followed by three more shots as he
passed down the line, and he fell dead at the feet of the minister,
with five balls in his body.</p>
<p>In the evening, after our return from a good day&rsquo;s sport, we
paid Jung Bahadoor a visit in his tent, and went with him to see the
elephants which had been caught for the service of the Government during
his year&rsquo;s absence from the country.&nbsp; In a square enclosure
were upwards of two hundred elephants of all sorts and sizes.&nbsp;
Here might be seen an elephant fastened between two others, and kept
quiet only by being dragged continually in two different directions
at once, no mahout having yet ventured to mount him; while, in evident
terror at her proximity to such a monster, stood an anxious mother performing
maternal duties to a young one not much larger than a calf, who was
in no way puzzled by the position of the udder between her fore legs,
but by a dexterous use of his trunk helped himself in a manner wonderfully
precocious for so young a baby; indeed, he seemed very much pleased
with having a trunk to play with, and certainly had a great advantage
over most babies in possessing so permanent a plaything.&nbsp; Behind
this interesting party stood a large elephant, with huge tusks, which
had been chiefly instrumental in the capture of the victims he was now
grimly surveying at a considerable distance, it not being safe to let
him approach too near, as he seemed to be under the delusion that every
elephant he saw still required to be caught.&nbsp; Each mahout now brought
forward the prizes he had captured since the commencement of the year,
and they were severally inspected: those which had no tufts of hair
at the tips of their tails, or were in any way deformed, were put aside
to be sold to unwary purchasers in India; while those approved by his
Excellency were reserved for the use of government, or, to speak in
plainer language, for his shooting parties.</p>
<p>As I do not know the points of an elephant as well as those of a
horse, the want of the tuft was the only mark I could distinguish.&nbsp;
However, the science of elephant-flesh seemed to be as deep and full
of mysteries as that of horse-flesh.</p>
<p>Having finished our inspection, and the pay of an unsuccessful mahout
or two having been stopped, Jung entered into a long disquisition upon
the subject of the wild sports of the Terai.&nbsp; He told us, amongst
other things, that he had forbidden all deer-shooting here, although
the revenue to Government upon the skins amounted to 400 or 500 pounds
a year, in order that he might enjoy better shooting.&nbsp; Of course,
we praised the love of sport which could prompt such an order, and said
nothing of the love of country which might perhaps have prevented it.&nbsp;
I was often struck by the despotic tone which the prime minister assumed,
and it only confirmed my previous opinion as to his substantially possessing
the sovereign power.</p>
<p>We killed five or six more deer and pigs before quitting Bisoleah
on the following day, our road to Bechiacor leading us through the great
forest, at this season perfectly healthy.&nbsp; We found our camp pitched
in the broad dry bed of a mountain torrent, which I observed to be filled
with fragments of granite and micaceous schist.</p>
<p>As the shades of evening closed in upon the valley, the scene became
extremely interesting: high upon the hill sides,&mdash;for we had reached
the base of the Cheriagotty hills,&mdash;groups of natives, crouching
round their fires, were sheltered only by grass huts, the labour of
an hour.&nbsp; While lights twinkled in the minister&rsquo;s camp, soldiers
were gathered round their watch-fires, and the villagers were assembled
near a huge crackling blaze to witness so unusual, and to them so exciting
a scene, as 5000 souls encamped in their solitary valley.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p><i>March to Hetowra&mdash;Cross the Cheriagotty Hills&mdash;Scenes
of the war of 1815-16&mdash;Preparations for a wild-elephant hunt&mdash;The
herd in full cry&mdash;A breakneck country&mdash;Furious charges of
wild elephants&mdash;The lost child&mdash;Return to camp</i>.</p>
<p>Early on the following morning we were on the march, and for five
miles did our clumsy elephant trip it heavily over the large stones
forming the bed of the stream in which we had been encamped the previous
night.&nbsp; I fear the beauty of the scenery did not so well compensate
him for the badness of the road as his more fortunate riders.&nbsp;
To see a hill at a distance after having travelled so long over a dead
level was refreshing; but when we began to wind round the base of precipitous
cliffs, or clamber up some romantic mountain pass, the effect was most
animating.</p>
<p>The cliffs which now frowned over us were about 500 feet in height;
a few larches crowning the summit indicated the elevation of the country,
and almost reminded us of home, until some monkeys swinging about amongst
the branches at once dispelled the illusion.</p>
<p>The hills themselves consist entirely of clay mixed with sandstone,
mica, and gravel; and the effect of the mountain torrents during the
rainy season upon such soft material had been to form precipitous gullies,
along which we were now passing, while the grotesque pinnacles which
constantly met the eye reminded us of the dolomite formation of the
Tyrol.&nbsp; In many places were strata, sometimes horizontal, but more
frequently inclined at an angle of about forty-five degrees, consisting
of limestone, hornstone, and conglomerate.</p>
<p>This range is called by Hodgson the sandstone range; it does not
rise more than 600 feet from its immediate base, its elevation above
the sea being about 3000 feet.&nbsp; The pass itself, by which we crossed
the Cheriagotty hills, was a mere watercourse, sometimes so narrow that
the banks on each side might be touched from the back of the elephant,
and so steep and rocky that, both in ascending and descending into the
dry bed of a torrent, the animal found no little difficulty in keeping
his footing.</p>
<p>It was in this place that some of the severest fighting took place
in 1816 during the Nepaulese war.&nbsp; Commanded by the surrounding
heights and crowned by the temporary stockades of the Ghorkas, it was
a dangerous and formidable obstacle to the progress of our army; but
the able tactics of Sir David Ochterlony successfully overcame it.&nbsp;
In the very watercourse we were now traversing the carcase of a dead
elephant had, on one occasion during that campaign, fallen in such a
manner as effectually to block up the way; and so narrow is the path,
and so steep the banks on each side, that the army was absolutely delayed
some time until this cumbrous impediment was removed.</p>
<p>After descending into the bed of the Chyria Nuddee our road lay through
the saul forest, the magnificent trees of which served as a grateful
shade for some miles, while, the road being comparatively level and
free from impediments, our journey was most agreeable.&nbsp; A short
distance from our destination we crossed the Kurroo Nuddee, by a picturesque
wooden bridge peculiar to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>Hetowra is a place of considerable importance in a mercantile point
of view, but it is not gay except during the season; it is, in fact,
fashionable only while it is healthy.&nbsp; From this place two roads
lead to Katmandu.&nbsp; The whole of our week&rsquo;s stay in the Terai
was rendered interesting to us from the recollection that in this province
originated a war as disastrous to our troops as it was unprovoked by
us.&nbsp; Never in our eastern experience have we commenced hostilities
with a native power upon more justifiable grounds, and seldom have we
paid more dearly for the satisfaction of at last dictating terms, from
which indeed we have since reaped no great advantage.&nbsp; At Persa,
but a short distance from Bisoleah, Captain Sibley and his detachment
fell into the hands of the enemy, losing two guns and three-fourths
of his men.&nbsp; Major-General Gillespie fell at the storming of Kalunga,
while gallantly cheering on his men; our casualties here amounting to
225, twenty of whom were officers.&nbsp; Beaten back on this occasion,
we were no less unsuccessful in a second attempt, losing in killed and
wounded 483 men, including eleven officers.&nbsp; It was only when General
Ochterlony assumed the command that affairs began to wear a brighter
aspect.&nbsp; The energy and ability of this officer were displayed
in a series of operations which daunted the enemy in proportion as they
inspired confidence amongst our own ranks, and the result of the campaign
was the expulsion of the Ghorkas from a large tract of country, which
was subsequently annexed to British India.&nbsp; Attempts at negotiation
were then made, which ultimately proved futile, and after the usual
amount of delay, specious professions, and deceit common to native Courts
generally had been practised by the Nepaul Durbar with a view to gain
time, open hostilities broke out with redoubled vigour on both sides.&nbsp;
General Ochterlony assumed the command of an army of 36,000 men, and
commenced the campaign by moving the main body at once across the Cheriagotty
hills, an operation involving incredible toil and difficulty, but which
was, nevertheless, performed with the greatest rapidity.&nbsp; From
Hetowra he advanced upon Muckwanpore, which, after two engagements,
fell into his hands, our loss amounting to nearly 300.&nbsp; This fort
commands the valley of Katmandu, and the Durbar therefore thought it
advisable to treat as speedily as possible.&nbsp; The terms which were
finally agreed upon differed little from those proposed on the former
occasion, leaving in our hands a portion of the Terai, and, what was
more important, giving the Ghorkas a more correct notion of the enemy
they had to deal with than they had gained from their experience in
the first campaign.</p>
<p>We found our camp prettily situated at the village of Hetowra, on
the Rapti, surrounded by hills clothed to their summits with evergreen
jungle, not unlike those I had lately left in Ceylon.</p>
<p>The Minister Sahib, having received information that a herd of wild
elephants were in the neighbourhood, paid us a visit immediately on
our arrival at camp, in a great state of excitement, and enjoined on
us the necessity of an early start if we wished to partake of a sport
which he promised would exceed anything we had ever witnessed, and prove
such as no European had ever before had an opportunity of joining in.</p>
<p>I was aroused about 3 on the following morning, by the tune of the
&lsquo;British Grenadiers,&rsquo; played by the bands of the two regiments,
which marched past my tent on their way to beat the jungle, and I wondered
whether its composer ever imagined that its inspiriting effects would
be exercised upon men bound on so singular a duty as those whose tramp
we now heard becoming fainter and fainter as they wound up the valley.&nbsp;
This was a signal for us to abandon our mattresses, which were always
spread on the ground, in default of a four-poster, but were none the
less comfortable or fascinating to their drowsy occupants on that account.&nbsp;
It was necessary to make such a morning&rsquo;s meal as should be sufficient
to last for 24 hours.&nbsp; This was rather a difficult matter at that
early hour, as we had eaten a large dinner overnight; however, we accomplished
it to the best of our power, and, jumping into our howdah, soon overtook
Jung, whom we accompanied to what was to be the scene of action, a thick
saul jungle on the banks of the Kurroo Nuddee, here a considerable stream.</p>
<p>Down a hill before us, and by a particular pass, the wild elephants
were to be driven by the united efforts of the gallant rifle corps,
a regiment of infantry, and a hundred elephants; while our party, which
comprised an equal number of these animals, was prepared to receive
their brethren of the woods.</p>
<p>Our patience as sportsmen was destined to be severely tried, and
mid-day came without any elephants having made their appearance: we
therefore lit a huge fire, and, dismounting, partook with Jung of some
very nice sweet biscuits and various specimens of native confectionery,
declining the green-looking mutton which was kindly pressed upon us.&nbsp;
Had the elephants chosen that moment to come down upon us, a curious
scene must have ensued: Jung&rsquo;s grapes would have gone one way
and his curry-powder the other&mdash;he was eating grapes and curry-powder
at the time; and his brother, who was toasting a large piece of mutton
on a reed, must have either burnt his mouth or lost the precious morsel:
however, the elephants did not come, so Jung finished his grapes and
curry-powder, and his brother waited till the mutton was cool, ate it
in peace, and went through the necessary ablutions.</p>
<p>He then gave me a lesson in cutting down trees with a kukri, a sort
of bill-hook, in the use of which the Nepaulese are peculiarly expert.&nbsp;
The Minister Sahib at one stroke cut through a saul-tree which was 13
inches in circumference, while sundry unsuccessful attempts which I
made on very small branches created great amusement among the bystanders
skilled in the use of the weapon.</p>
<p>At last a dropping shot or two were heard in the distance: this was
the signal of the approach of the herd, and I was put by the minister
through the exercises necessary to be acquired before commencing the
novel chace.</p>
<p>Taking off my shoes and tying a towel round my head, I was told to
suppose an immense branch to be in front of me, and was taught to escape
its sweeping effects by sliding down the crupper of the elephant, and
keeping the whole of my body below the level of his back, thus allowing
the branch to pass within an inch above it without touching me.&nbsp;
In the same manner, upon a branch threatening me from the right or left,
it was necessary to throw myself on the opposite side, hanging only
by my hands, and swinging myself into my original position by a most
violent exertion, which required at the same time considerable knack.&nbsp;
Having perfected myself in these accomplishments to the utmost of my
power, I awaited in patience the arrival of the elephants.</p>
<p>Looking round, I saw Jung himself, seated in the place of the mahout,
guiding the elephant which he bestrode very cleverly.&nbsp; When silence
was required he made a peculiar clucking noise with his tongue; whereupon
these docile creatures immediately became still and motionless: one
would drop the tuft of grass which he was tearing up, another would
stop instantly from shaking the dust out of the roots which he was preparing
to eat, others left off chewing their food.&nbsp; When a few seconds
of the most perfect calm had elapsed, the rooting up and dusting out
went on more briskly than ever, and the mouthful was doubly sweet to
those who were now allowed to finish the noisy process of mastication.</p>
<p>At last our patience was rewarded, and Jung gave the signal for us
to advance.</p>
<p>On each elephant there were now two riders, the mahout and a man
behind, who, armed with a piece of hard wood into which two or three
spikes were inserted, hammered the animal about the root of the tail
as with a mallet.&nbsp; He was furnished with a looped rope to hold
on by, and a sack stuffed with straw to sit upon, and was expected to
belabour the elephant with one hand while he kept himself on its back
with the other.</p>
<p>This was the position I filled on this trying occasion; but my elephant
fared well as regarded the instrument of torture, for I was much too
fully occupied in taking care of myself to think of using it.&nbsp;
Away we went at full speed, jostling one another up banks and through
streams, and I frequently was all but jolted off the diminutive sack
which ought to have formed my seat, but did not, for I found it impossible
to sit.&nbsp; Being quite unable to maintain any position for two moments
together, I looked upon it as a miracle that every bone in my body was
not broken.&nbsp; Sometimes I was suddenly jerked into a sitting posture,
and, not being able to get my heels from under me in time, they received
a violent blow.&nbsp; A moment after I was thrown forward on my face,
only righting myself in time to see a huge impending branch, which I
had to escape by slipping rapidly down the crupper, taking all the skin
off my toes in so doing, and, what would have been more serious, the
branch nearly taking my head off if I did not stoop low enough.&nbsp;
When I could look about me, the scene was most extraordinary and indescribable:
a hundred elephants were tearing through the jungle as rapidly as their
unwieldy forms would let them, crushing down the heavy jungle in their
headlong career, while their riders were gesticulating violently, each
man punishing his elephant, or making a bolster of himself as he flung
his body on one side or the other to avoid branches; while some, Ducrow-like,
and confident in their activity, were standing on the bare backs of
their elephants, holding only by the looped rope,&mdash;a feat I found
easy enough in the open country, but fearfully dangerous in the jungle.&nbsp;
A few yards in front of us was a wild elephant with her young one, both
going away in fine style, the pace being 8 or 9 miles an hour.&nbsp;
I was just beginning to appreciate the sport, and was contemplating
hammering my elephant so as to be up amongst the foremost, when we,
in company with about half a dozen others, suddenly disappeared from
the scene.&nbsp; A nullah, or deep drain, hidden in the long grass,
had engulfed elephants and riders.&nbsp; The suddenness of the shock
unseated me, but fortunately I did not lose my hold of the rope, and
more fortunately still my elephant did not roll over, but, balancing
himself on his knees, with the assistance of his trunk, made a violent
effort, and succeeded in getting out of his uncomfortable position.</p>
<p>The main body of the chace had escaped this nullah by going round
the top of it; but we were not so much thrown out as I expected, for
we arrived in time to see the wild elephant charging and struggling
in the midst of her pursuers, who, after several attempts, finally succeeded
in noosing her, and dragging her away in triumph between two tame elephants,
each attached to the wild one by a rope, and pulling different ways
whenever she was inclined to be unmanageable.&nbsp; I was watching the
struggles which the huge beast made, and wondering how the young one,
who was generally almost under the mother, had escaped being crushed
in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, when a perfect roll of small arms turned
our attention to another quarter, and I saw an elephant with an imposing
pair of tusks charging down upon us through a square of soldiers, which
had just been broken by it, and who were now taking to the trees in
all directions.&nbsp; I ought to remark, lest the gallant riflemen should
be under the imputation of want of valour in this proceeding, that they
were only allowed to fire blank cartridge.&nbsp; The elephant next to
me stood the brunt of the charge, which was pretty severe, while mine
created a diversion by butting him violently in the side, and, being
armed with a formidable pair of tusks, made a considerable impression;
the wild one was soon completely overpowered by numbers, after throwing
up his trunk and charging wildly in all directions.&nbsp; Of the violence
of one of these charges I have retained visible proof, for a splintered
tusk, which had been broken short off in the combat, was afterwards
picked up and given to me as a trophy.&nbsp; Having succeeded in noosing
this elephant also, we were dragging him away in the usual manner between
two others, when he snapped one of the ropes and started off, pulling
after him the elephant that still remained attached to him, and dashed
through the jungle at full speed, notwithstanding the struggles of the
involuntary companion of his flight.&nbsp; For a moment I feared that
the courage of the mahout would give way in that pell-mell career, and
that he would slip the rope which bound the two animals together.&nbsp;
But he held on manfully, and after another exciting chace we succeeded
in surrounding the maddened monster; my elephant jostled him so closely
that I could touch him as we went neck and neck.&nbsp; It is a curious
fact that the elephants never seem to think of uncurling their trunks,
and sweeping their persecutors from the backs of their tame brethren:
this they have never been known to do, though it has not unfrequently
occurred that a wild herd have proved more than a match for the tame
one, and then there is nothing for it but to turn and make off in an
ignominious retreat as fast as the blows of the mahouts can urge them.&nbsp;
It is only under these circumstances that there is any danger to the
riders, and such an occurrence can take place only when the tame herd
is small, and encounters an unusually large number of the wild elephants.&nbsp;
Upon this occasion we mustered so strong that defeat was out of the
question.</p>
<p>We now heard a terrific bellowing at a short distance, which, in
my ignorance, I thought proceeded from a huge tusker making a gallant
resistance somewhere; I was rather disappointed, therefore, to find
that the object of interest to a large group of men and elephants was
only a young one struggling on his back in a deep hole into which he
had fallen, and from which he was totally unable to extricate himself.&nbsp;
Lying on his back, and kicking his legs wildly about in the air, he
looked the most ridiculous object imaginable, and certainly made more
noise in proportion to his size than any baby I ever heard.&nbsp; So
incessant was his roaring that we could scarcely hear each other speak;
at last, by means of ropes attached to various parts of his body, and
by dint of a great deal of pulling and hauling, we extricated the unfortunate
infant from his awkward position.</p>
<p>The poor little animal had not had a long life before experiencing
its ups and downs, and it now looked excessively bewildered at not finding
its mother, who had escaped with the rest of the herd.&nbsp; He was
soon consoled, however, by being allotted to a tame matron, who did
not seem particularly pleased at being thus installed in the office
of foster mother whether she liked it or not.</p>
<p>We now all jogged home in great spirits, and, though Jung professed
himself dissatisfied with only having captured four out of a herd of
twelve, we were perfectly contented with a day&rsquo;s work which my
elephant-shooting experience in Ceylon had never seen equalled, and
which so fully realised the promise made by the minister at starting,
that we should be the first to partake of a sport to be met with only
in the noble forests of his native country.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p><i>March to Bhimphede&mdash;National defences&mdash;The Cheesapany
pass&mdash;Lovely scenery&mdash;Night adventure&mdash;The watch-fire&mdash;Reception
at camp&mdash;Arrival at Katmandu</i>.</p>
<p>We had looked forward with no little anxiety to the morning following
our elephant-hunt, as we were to go in search of rhinoceros: it was
therefore a severe disappointment to us when Jung entered our tent at
daylight, and informed us that it was necessary we should at once proceed
on our way to Katmandu.&nbsp; The reason he gave us was, that we should
have to go too far out of our route before we could find our game: however
that might be, there was no help for it, and we commenced our march
up the valley of the Rapti, along the narrow rocky path leading to Bhimphede,
our next halting-place.&nbsp; It was a five hours&rsquo; march, and
we crossed the river thirty-two times before we came in sight of the
picturesque Durumsolah, or native rest-house, which is situated at the
head of the valley.&nbsp; Hills clothed to their summits with variegated
jungle rose above us to an immense but not uniform height, and the scenery
looked bolder as we became more enclosed among the mountains.</p>
<p>Bhimphede is a Newar village, the inhabitants being the aborigines
of the country.&nbsp; It is said to derive its name from a Hindoo divinity
named Bheem having on some occasion happened to stop there.&nbsp; It
is distant from Hetowra about 18 miles, and the road might be much improved
by a little engineering.</p>
<p>The present policy of the Nepaul government is to keep the roads
by which their country is approached in as impassable a state as possible,
vainly imagining that, in case of a war, the badness of the roads would
offer an insuperable obstacle to our progress, and compel us to relinquish
any attempt to penetrate to Katmandu.&nbsp; This delusion ought to have
been dispelled by the occupation of Muckwanpore by Sir David Ochterlony;
not that it is a contingency they need take much trouble to provide
against, since it would never be worth our while to do more than take
possession of the Terai.</p>
<p>The present state of the roads renders it impossible for goods to
be conveyed into Nepaul, except upon men&rsquo;s backs; and as the traffic
would be considerable in various articles of commerce, the prosperity
and wealth of the country would be incalculably increased by an improvement
in the means of transit.</p>
<p>Jung Bahadoor is quite alive to the real state of the case, and sees
at once the absurdity of the policy pursued by the Nepaul government,
but he feels that any innovation of the sort would be too unpopular
for him to attempt in his present position.&nbsp; His recently imbibed
liberal notions coincide but little with the cramped ideas of a semi-barbarous
durbar.&nbsp; He is well aware that neither bad roads, troops, nor any
other obstacle that he could oppose to our advance, would avail in case
of our invading Nepaul.&nbsp; His feeling as regards a war with the
British was not inaptly expressed in a remark he once made to me,&mdash;&ldquo;If
a cat is pushed into a corner it will fly at an elephant, but it will
always try to keep out of the corner as long as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Bhimphede, where we arrived about mid-day, I dismounted from the
elephant on which I had journeyed comfortably for 200 miles, and for
which I had begun to feel quite an affection, and was soon high up the
precipitous ascent of the Cheesapany pass.&nbsp; It crosses a mountain
which rises nearly 2000 feet above the village at its base; the path
is so steep that a horse can barely scramble up it; and the ascent of
the Rigi, in Switzerland, seemed a mere nothing in comparison: this
pass in its turn is not nearly so steep as the Chandernagiri, which
is the last pass before you descend into the valley of Katmandu.</p>
<p>Having so much mountain work before me, I determined on walking the
rest of the journey, that being the most satisfactory and enjoyable
way of travelling across a highland country and viewing its scenery;
my companion betook himself to a cot or dandy swung on a pole, preferring
that method of getting carried over the hills to the one in general
use amongst the natives, which I imagine is peculiar to Nepaul.&nbsp;
An open-mouthed conical basket, like that of the Parisian chiffonnier,
but with contents in some respects different, since this contains the
traveller and not the shreds of his exploded journal, is fastened upon
the back of a bearer by a strap across his forehead and two others over
his shoulders; the occupant sits with his legs over the rim of the basket,
and his back almost resting against the head of his bearer, who, bending
forward under the weight of his load, and grasping a long stick, looks
like some decrepit old man&mdash;a delusion which vanishes the instant
you commence the ascent of a mountain by his side, when his endurance
and vigour astonish you, if they do not knock you up.</p>
<p>Before we had toiled half way up the precipitous ascent, the view,
that great alleviator of fatigue to the mountain traveller, was suddenly
hidden from us by a thick mist in which we became enveloped, and which,
rolling slowly over the hills, hid from our gaze a magnificent panorama
of the lovely valley along which our morning&rsquo;s march had led us,
and which lay stretched at our feet.&nbsp; With its broad stream winding
down its centre, it reminded me of many similar valleys in Switzerland
and the Tyrol, more particularly the Engadine, as seen from the hill
above Nauders; while the hills, richly clad with masses of dark foliage,
and rising to a height of two or three thousand feet, more nearly resembled
those of the Cinnamon Isle.&nbsp; There is a fort near the summit of
the pass with a few hundred soldiers, and a sort of custom-house, at
which two sentries are placed for the purpose of levying a tax amounting
to about sixpence upon every bundle passing either in or out of the
Nepaul dominions; whether it be a bundle of grass or a bale of the valuable
fabric manufactured from the shawl-goat of Thibet, the same charge is
made, rendering it a grievously heavy tax upon the poor man with his
load of wood, while it is a matter of no importance to the rich merchant
whose coolies are freighted with rare and valuable merchandise.</p>
<p>Having accomplished nearly half the descent of the opposite side,
we emerged from the mist, and a view of a wilder valley opened up, in
which the streams were more rapid and furious, and the mountains which
enclosed it more rugged and precipitous.&nbsp; A few trees, principally
firs, were here and there scattered over the bare face of the mountain
wherever they could find a sufficiently-sheltered nook.&nbsp; Enterprising
settlers had perched themselves upon the naked shoulders of the hills,
or were more snugly ensconced below by the side of the brawling stream,
which was crossed here and there by primitive bridges, consisting of
a log or two thrown from one heap of stones to another, with a few turfs
laid upon them.</p>
<p>I observed in the Nepaul valleys&mdash;what must be the case in every
country in which the hills are composed of a soft material&mdash;deltas
formed by the soil which is washed down by the mountain torrents.&nbsp;
The mass of debris in the valley often extends quite across it, and
forces the stream through a gorge, frequently of considerable grandeur
in those places where the power of the torrent during the rains is very
great.</p>
<p>This circumstance adds greatly to the beauty of the scenery in the
Tyrol, where the limestone formation of the hills thus worked upon spreads
a soil in swelling knolls over the valley, on which the most luxuriant
vineyards are picturesquely terraced.&nbsp; The effect, however, is
very different in Nepaul, where the hills are composed chiefly of gravel
and conglomerate; the deltas, consequently, produce crops of stones
more frequently than of anything else.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the want
of cultivation in the valley on which we were now looking down, it was
full of a sublime beauty, the mountains at either end towering to a
height of three or four thousand feet, while the path we were to follow
was to be seen on the opposite side, winding over a formidable range,
and always appearing to mount the steepest hills and to go down unnecessarily
into innumerable valleys.&nbsp; It was with no little regret then that
we made the almost interminable descent, apparently for the mere purpose
of starting fair from the bottom of the valley, before we commenced
the arduous climb in store for us over a range still higher than the
one we had just traversed.</p>
<p>We crossed the stream at the bottom by a single-arched bridge of
curious mechanism and peculiar to the Himalayas, the chief advantage
being the large span, which admits of an immense body of water rushing
through; a necessary precaution in the case of a mountain torrent.&nbsp;
We then toiled up the hillside by a fearfully narrow path.&nbsp; At
times my companion seemed absolutely hanging over the precipice; and
our path was not in some places above twelve inches broad; had we slipped
we must inevitably have become food for the fishes in the Pomonia, which
was gliding rapidly along some hundreds of feet below, and which we
were informed was a good trouting stream.</p>
<p>At last we reached the summit of the range, from which we had a lovely
view of the surrounding country; the hills were just tipped by the setting
sun; but this fact, while it added to the beauty of the scene, materially
detracted from our enjoyment of it.&nbsp; In a few moments more we should
be benighted, and we had still two hours&rsquo; walk to the village
for which we were bound.&nbsp; Accordingly, we had scarcely commenced
the descent when it became so dark that it was no longer possible to
distinguish the path; and having a vivid recollection of the precipices
I had already passed, I felt no inclination to risk a fall of a few
hundred feet.&nbsp; After making some little progress by feeling our
way with sticks, we found it hopeless, and fairly gave in, having no
alternative but to make the narrow path we were on our resting-place
for the remainder of the night.&nbsp; This was a most disagreeable prospect,
and we regretted that we had allowed Jung and his suite to ride on.&nbsp;
The minister had recommended us to follow in cots, as he thought the
road was too bad for men accustomed to level country to ride along.&nbsp;
It was vain to tell him that we could ride where he could, or that we
had seen hills before we came to Nepaul; he insisted that he was responsible
for our safety, and would not hear of our riding.&nbsp; As we had little
anticipated so arduous a march at starting, we had not thought it worth
while further to contest the point with one who knew the country so
well; and now, when it was too late, we sincerely wished ourselves comfortably
lodged in his camp.</p>
<p>I had already walked for six consecutive hours over roads exceeding
in danger and difficulty most of the mountain passes in Switzerland,
and began to feel fatigued and not a little hungry, seeing that I had
not touched a morsel of food since daybreak, with the exception of a
crust of bread that I had found in my pocket.&nbsp; Thus the prospect
of stretching myself out on a slippery path, with a stone for my pillow,
and the contemplation of my miseries for my supper, was anything but
agreeable.</p>
<p>As we were in this humour it was not to be wondered at that an intelligent
soldier, whom we had for a guide, came in for a certain amount of our
indignation when he informed us that it was still four coss (eight miles)
to Pheer Phing, the place to which we were bound.&nbsp; Base deceiver!&mdash;he
had told us at starting that it was not quite four coss, and now, after
walking hard for six hours, we had got rather farther from it than we
were at starting.&nbsp; It was impossible, at this rate, to say when
our journey would come to an end.&nbsp; Nor could we get him to admit
his error, and own that one or other of his statements must be wrong.&nbsp;
He was a good-hearted fellow withal, and bore us no malice for our ill
temper, but gave me a walking-stick and an orange as peace-offerings.&nbsp;
However, he rigidly maintained his assertion as to the distance, at
the same time suggesting that we should push on, encouraging us with
the assurance that the rest of the path was a maidan or dead level.&nbsp;
As he had made a similar statement at starting, and as the only bit
of level walking we could remember was a log bridge, over which we had
crossed, we knew too well what amount of confidence to put in this assertion.</p>
<p>At last one of the bearers who had gone on to explore the path ahead
came back with the animating intelligence &ldquo;that he saw a fire.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We therefore determined to make for it with all diligence, and soon
perceived the bright glare of a large watch-fire, with a party of soldiers
crowded round it.&nbsp; We gladly joined them, and while one of their
number was sent forward for torches we rolled ourselves in our cloaks
near the crackling blaze, for the night was bitterly cold; and, heaping
up fresh logs upon the fire, a bright flame lit up the wild scene.</p>
<p>We forgot our miseries as we watched the picturesque group of weather-beaten
Ghorkas, or gathered what we could from their conversation, of their
opinions upon the politics of the country, and the trip of the prime
minister, on both which subjects they expressed themselves pretty freely,
and took pains to impress upon us how anxious they were for our safe
arrival in camp, informing us that their heads would be the price of
any accident that should happen to us.&nbsp; At last the torches were
seen flickering on the opposite hill, and soon afterwards we commenced
our march in picturesque procession, passing over rugged ascents, across
brawling rocky streams, and down dark romantic glens, until we began
to think that the existence of Pheer Phing was a fiction.</p>
<p>It was about nine o&rsquo;clock when I perceived we had entered a
town which, by its brick pavement and high houses, I concluded to be
a large one.&nbsp; After crossing three ranges of mountains, each nearly
two thousand feet high, we did not much speculate upon anything but
the distance still to be travelled; and the numerous lights twinkling
in the distance were a welcome evidence of the proximity of Jung&rsquo;s
encampment.&nbsp; The minister came out and received us cordially, expressing
his regret at our misadventure and the anxiety he had been in as to
our fate; for the route we had taken was not the ordinary one, but one
of those short cuts which so often prove the unwary traveller&rsquo;s
greatest misfortune.&nbsp; As our servants had not yet come up, he insisted
upon our partaking of the repast he had prepared for us.&nbsp; I did
not require a second invitation, and all scruples vanished as I looked
with delight at the little leaf cups containing the scented greasy condiments
formerly despised, and unhesitatingly plunged my fingers (for of course
there were no spoons or forks) into a mass of rice and mixed it incontinently
with everything within reach, disregarding the Jung&rsquo;s remonstrances,
that this was salt-fish and the other sweetmeat, and that they would
not be good together.&nbsp; After fasting for fifteen hours, and being
in hard exercise the greater part of that time, one is not disposed
to be particular, and to this day I have not the slightest conception
what I devoured for the first ten minutes; at the end of that time my
first sensation was peculiarly disagreeable&mdash;namely, that my hunger
was sufficiently appeased to allow me to consider what I was eating;
at this point I stopped, still rather hungry, but better off than my
companion, who, having retained his presence of mind, had not touched
anything.</p>
<p>We now got into palanquins prepared for us, and arrived at the residency
at Katmandu at three in the morning, in a comatose state, arising partly
from fatigue, partly from drowsiness, but chiefly, I imagine, from peculiar
feeding.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p><i>The British residency&mdash;Houses at the temple of Pusputnath&mdash;Unprepossessing
appearance of the Newar population&mdash;Their dress and characteristic
features&mdash;Ghorkas&mdash;Temple of Pusputnath&mdash;View from the
hill above it&mdash;The temple of Bhood&mdash;Worshippers from Thibet
and Chinese Tartary&mdash;Their singular and disgusting appearance&mdash;Striking
scene in the grand square of the city of Katmandu</i>.</p>
<p>I did not awake until the day was far advanced, and my first impulse
was to look out of my window, with no little curiosity, expecting to
see the Snowy Range somewhere in the heavens near the sun; in this I
was disappointed, for the mist was so dense that neither sun nor Snowy
Range was visible; we therefore determined to go in search of less exalted
objects of interest.</p>
<p>But ere we canter away from the door of the residency upon the shaggy
little ponies which had been provided for our use by the Durbar, the
Company&rsquo;s establishment in Nepaul demands a moment&rsquo;s attention.&nbsp;
In the only thoroughly independent state extant in India the British
Government is represented by a Resident, to whose hospitality we were
much indebted during our delightful stay in Katmandu.&nbsp; His house,
a Gothic mansion of a rather gingerbread appearance, is situated in
a well laid-out park-like enclosure, which forms the residency grounds,
and which contains two or three neat substantial houses, the habitations
of the two officers of the embassy.&nbsp; One of them kindly accompanied
us in our search after sights, and directed our steps in the first instance
to the temple of Pusputnath.&nbsp; We passed through the suburbs of
Katmandu by a road beautifully paved, in some places with brick, in
others with granite.&nbsp; It was along this road that the body of Martiber
Singh, the late prime minister, and uncle of Jung Bahadooor, was dragged
after he had been shot by his nephew, and was burned on the bank of
the Bhagmutty before the soldiery (with whom he was an especial favourite)
had any idea of his having been killed.</p>
<p>As I approached the temple I remarked some handsome houses, three
or four stories in height, which we were informed were the residences
of some of the priests.&nbsp; As they were good specimens of the architecture
of this country, I may as well describe them here.</p>
<p>The whole front of the Nepaulese houses presented a mass of curiously
carved wood-work, so that the beautiful flat brick of which they were
built (and for the manufacture of which Nepaul is famous) was scarcely
discernible amidst the intricate tracery which surrounded every window,
and hung in broad wooden fringes from the balconies: these are formed
under the eaves, which project five or six feet, and are supported by
rafters, on which quaint figures are depicted in all sorts of impossible
postures; the space between the rafters is also filled by carved wood,
forming a sort of balcony or small room, generally occupied by the women
of the establishment, and flat faces peer out of grotesque windows as
you pass beneath.</p>
<p>But it must not be imagined that the same attraction exists here
as in other Oriental countries to induce you to return their gaze.&nbsp;
On the contrary, the female portion of the Nepaulese community is anything
but attractive.&nbsp; I have seldom seen a race look more debased and
squalid.&nbsp; Sometimes a florid tint about the nose and cheek-bones
seems to hint at an affection for the bottle; while their flowing or
rather tangled locks, and slovenly dress, might fairly induce the suspicion
that they had but lately parted company with it.&nbsp; The Newar women,
however, were ladylike in their appearance, when compared with some
of the Bootya tribe with whom I afterwards made acquaintance.</p>
<p>It would, perhaps, be hardly fair to these copper-coloured ladies
to judge entirely from their appearance, but, from what I could learn,
it did not belie them, except, of course, as regards their friendship
for the bottle, drunkenness being a vice which is not prevalent, though
the strictness with respect to intoxicating liquors, so remarkable amongst
the Hindoos of the plains, is by no means observable among the hill
tribes.</p>
<p>The dress of the men consists of a short coat, not unlike a shooting-coat,
reaching about half-way to the knees, and composed of a coarse cotton
fabric manufactured in the country, from a tree which is a native of
some of the lower valleys, but which I did not see in the valley of
Katmandu.</p>
<p>In the colder months they wear home-spun woollen clothes.&nbsp; The
dress of the women differs little from that of the men, except that
the coat is longer, resembling a dressing-gown, and a sort of bodice
is generally worn beneath it; a white shawl wrapped round the waist
completes one of the most ungraceful costumes imaginable.&nbsp; All
the men and some of the women are armed with the kukri, a heavy-bladed
weapon or knife of singular shape.&nbsp; But lest this be too unprepossessing
a picture of the Newars, or aborigines of Nepaul (for the Ghorkas are
a superior and very different race), I should remark that I had no opportunity
of seeing any of the females of the higher orders of either nation.&nbsp;
The Ghorkas, being, for the most part, bigoted Hindoos, are prevented
by their religion from allowing the women to appear in public.&nbsp;
The Newars, not fettered by any such restraint, can now boast very few
noble families; the ancient grandees of the Newar dynasty are extirpated,
with the exception of one or two of the old aristocracy, who are in
the last stage of decay.&nbsp; I cannot agree with Colonel Kirkpatrick
(who wrote an account of his visit to Nepaul in 1803) in thinking that,
&ldquo;though the Newars have round and rather flat faces, small eyes,
and low spreading noses, they bear no resemblance to Chinese features;&rdquo;
on the contrary, I was much struck with the great similarity of the
mass of the lower orders to the Chinese.&nbsp; Their imperturbable good
humour and unaffected simplicity as plainly proved them a hill race,
as did their picturesque dwellings and sturdy limbs.&nbsp; Altogether
this class of the inhabitants of Nepaul are a cheerful, happy race,
for whom one could feel a sort of affection after becoming reconciled
to their appearance; but a woman is certainly not fascinating when what
ought to be nose is nothing but cheek with two holes in it, and what
ought to be neck is almost body as well.&nbsp; If people have protuberances
in wrong places, it of course requires a little time for the eye to
become accustomed to them.&nbsp; It may be that a go&icirc;tre is a
beauty in the eyes of many a young Nepaulese swain.&nbsp; It matters
little, however, to a young Newar bride whether her husband admires
her or not, for she is at liberty to claim a divorce whenever she pleases,
and, if her second choice be not of lower caste than herself, she may
leave him at pleasure and return to her original spouse, resuming the
charge of any family she may have had by him.</p>
<p>The Ghorkas are the conquerors of Nepaul, and now compose the army;
they have grants of land called jaghires, on which they live when not
actually on service.&nbsp; They are a handsome and independent race,
priding themselves upon not being able to do anything but fight; and
in their free and sometimes noble carriage often reminded me of the
Tyrolese.</p>
<p>Besides the Ghorkas and Newars there are two or three other tribes,
each consisting of but a limited number, and possessing no peculiar
distinguishing marks, except the differences to be found in their religious
opinions, which are generally a mixture of the Bhuddist and Hindoo creeds.</p>
<p>But to return to the temple of Pusputnath.&nbsp; This celebrated
edifice is said to have been erected by Pussoopush Deoth, the fourth
prince of the Soorijbunsee dynasty; and so sacred is the temple considered,
that a pilgrimage to its shrines is held to be more meritorious than
any other act that can be performed by a Hindoo.&nbsp; As the massive
folding-doors opened before us, the view of the court-yard was certainly
more striking than anything I had yet seen of the sort.&nbsp; Immediately
opposite the handsome gateway, and situated in the centre of the court-yard,
was the temple, roofed with lead, while the edges were ornamented with
a profusion of gold leaf.&nbsp; Beside the large doors of massive silver
were finely carved windows, covered in all directions with devices in
the same precious metal.</p>
<p>Four sculptured lions guarded the double flight of steps, while at
the bottom of the principal flight was a large figure of a kneeling
bull (nanda), executed in copper, and superbly gilt.&nbsp; The rest
of the court-yard was filled with images and shrines of various descriptions;
a kneeling figure of Siva, a huge bell, more lions, and other sacred
objects being studded throughout it in odd confusion.&nbsp; After looking
at the varied and somewhat brilliant objects about us, our attention
was directed to the roof of the temple, and certainly the transition
from the sublime to the ridiculous was extraordinary.&nbsp; Pots, pans,
old kukris, dusty-looking musical instruments, goods and chattels of
all descriptions, such as one might imagine would form the contents
of a Nepaulese pawnbroker&rsquo;s shop, if there is any such establishment
here, were wedged together indiscriminately beneath the projecting roof
of the pagoda, for of that Chinese form was this much venerated <i>Hindoo</i>
temple.&nbsp; This mass of incongruous wares, as far as I could learn,
was composed of the unclaimed goods of pious worshippers, persons dying
without known heirs, and certainly, to judge from their appearance,
the heirs did not lose much by not establishing their claims.</p>
<p>We ascended the hill, immediately under which the temple is situated,
and were charmed with the lovely prospect which it commanded.&nbsp;
On the left, and clothing with its brilliant colours a gentle slope,
was the grove sacred to Siva, divided by the equally sacred Bhagmutty
from the temple we had just visited, and into which we now looked down.&nbsp;
The Bhagmutty was crossed by two narrow Chinese-looking bridges, resembling
those we have such frequent opportunities of admiring on the willow-pattern
plates.&nbsp; It is at this sacred spot that devout Hindoos wish to
die with their feet in the water.&nbsp; Here it is that the bodies of
the great are burnt; Martibar Singh was reduced to ashes at the end
of the bridge, and so was the Ranee not three months before my visit,
together with two favourite female slaves, whose society she did not
wish to relinquish.</p>
<p>Beyond this interesting foreground stretched the luxuriant valley,
its gentle slopes and eminences terraced to their summits, which were
often crowned by some old fortified Newar town: the terraces, tinged
with the brilliant green of the young crops, rose one above another
to the base of the walls, while beneath the Bhagmutty wound its tortuous
course to the romantic gorge in the mountains, through which it leaves
this favoured valley to traverse lazily the uninteresting plains of
upper India.</p>
<p>A peak of the gigantic Himaleh, bursting through the bank of clouds
which had hitherto obscured it, reared its snow-capped summit far up
towards the skies, and completed this noble prospect.</p>
<p>Crossing the river, we proceeded to visit the temple sacred to Bhood,
the resort of the numerous tribes of Bhootiyas, or inhabitants of the
highlands of Thibet and Chinese Tartary, who perform annual pilgrimages
hither in the winter, but are obliged to return to their homes early
in the spring, being unable to endure the heat of a Nepaulese summer.</p>
<p>This remarkable building was visible some time before we reached
it, and is of the form peculiar to Bhuddist places of worship in other
parts of the world, but more particularly in Anuradhupoora and the ancient
cities of Ceylon, the ruins of which bear testimony to the existence
of larger Dagobas than that before which the followers of the Bhuddist
faith worship in the valley of Katmandu.</p>
<p>The pyramidal summit was gorgeously gilt, and terminated in a huge
bell adorned in the same glittering manner, producing a brilliant effect
as it brightly reflected the rays of the noonday sun.&nbsp; The massive
stone platform on which the Dagoba stood was square; the ascent to it
on each side was by a broad flight of steps, but, on the lower part
of the pyramid, staring Chinese-looking eyes, painted in brilliant colours,
detracted considerably from the imposing effect which a massive pile
of stone and brick, not less than 120 feet high, would otherwise have
produced.</p>
<p>We rode round it in a sort of court-yard, enclosed by small two-storied
houses, which were very filthy, and out of which emerged men, women,
and children, very filthy also; we were soon encompassed by a crowd
of the most disreputable, dissolute-looking wretches imaginable.&nbsp;
The women were dressed in thick woollen gowns, which had once been red,
and reached a little below the knee; these were loosely fastened round
the waist, remaining open or closed above as the case might be.&nbsp;
The children, notwithstanding the inclement temperature, were in the
cool and airy costume common to the rising generation in the East.&nbsp;
The men were dressed exactly like the women; their matted hair and beard,
flat noses, and wide eyes, generally bloodshot, giving them a disgusting
appearance.&nbsp; Both sexes wore a sort of woollen gaiter, open at
the calf, the protruding muscle of which looked as if nothing could
have confined it; their shoes, as far as the dust would allow me to
see, were of the same material.&nbsp; They seemed good-natured and inoffensive,
but are not free from the vice of drunkenness; they consume quantities
of tea prepared with rancid lard.</p>
<p>Had I been asked to determine the origin of this race, I should have
pronounced it to be a mixture of Naples lazzaroni with the scum of an
Irish regiment.&nbsp; The ruddy complexions of some of the women, and
the swarthy look of many of the men, might fairly warrant such a conclusion.&nbsp;
They were so importunate and offensive as they pressed round me that
I hurried over my sketch of the temple, and made my escape from them,
not, however, without once more looking round with interest on the crowd
of beings whose distant habitations were upon the northern slope of
the Himalayan chain, hitherto unvisited by any European, except Dr.
Hooker, and consequently almost totally unknown.</p>
<p>I quite envied them the journey they were about to undertake, which
would occupy them three weeks; the large droves of sheep by which they
are always accompanied carried their limited worldly possessions, together
with the various tokens of civilization which they had procured in the
(to them) highly civilized country they were now visiting, and on which
no doubt their Bhootan friends would look with no little awe and wonderment.</p>
<p>This wandering and singular race do not visit Nepaul solely to worship
at the temple of Bhood, but have an eye to business as well as religion.&nbsp;
I shall have occasion by and by to speak of the numerous articles which
they import into Nepaul, on the backs of sheep, over the rocky passes
which lead from the cold region they inhabit.</p>
<p>On our way from the temple of Bhood, which, by the by, had just been
furbished up and whitewashed by a great man from H&rsquo;Lassa, an emissary
of the Grand Lama&rsquo;s, we passed through the town of Katmandu, which
was entered by a massive gateway, the city being surrounded by a wall.&nbsp;
Long narrow streets, very fairly paved, lead in all directions; the
houses are not so high as those of Benares or Cairo, the streets are
broader, and some of them would admit of the passage of a carriage.&nbsp;
They are all well drained and comparatively clean, contrasting most
favourably in that respect with any other Oriental town I have ever
seen.&nbsp; The streets were filled with foot-passengers, in bright
and variegated costumes, passing busily on, or stopping to make purchases
at the shops, which were on the ground-floor, with the whole front open,
and the merchant sitting in the midst of his wares.&nbsp; The next story
is inhabited, I believe, by his family; but I did not gain an entrance
into any of the common houses.&nbsp; The outside front generally presented
a mass of wood carving, each small window surrounded by a border two
or three feet broad, while under the eaves of the house projected the
singular balcony I have already described.</p>
<p>The great square, in which is situated the Durbar, or palace of the
King, presented in itself almost all the characteristic features of
a Nepaul town.&nbsp; As it suddenly burst upon us on turning the corner
of the long street leading from the city-gate, the view was in every
respect most striking.&nbsp; This square, or court, is well paved, and
contains the Chinese pagoda, composed entirely of wood, from which it
is a said the town derives its name.&nbsp; Its three or four roofs,
glittering one above another, are supported by grotesque representations
of unknown deities, and figures of all sizes and colours, not always
of the most proper description.&nbsp; The whole formed a mass of green,
gold leaf, and vermilion; and was guarded by a sentry, who, in order
to be in keeping with his charge, wore a long flowing gown of bright
colours, reaching to his ankles, and marched backwards and forwards
at the top of a long flight of steps.&nbsp; A couple of well-carved
lions, in grey sandstone, guarded the lower steps as efficiently as
he did the upper ones.&nbsp; There were at least four pagodas, painted
in like way, and guarded in like manner, in the great square of Katmandu.&nbsp;
The guard-house contained a large stand of arms of antique construction.&nbsp;
There was also the Durbar, the residence of the Rajah, a straggling
building, almost European in its style, and gaudy enough to please even
the late King of Bavaria; close to it was a huge deformed image of Siva,
sitting in an uncomfortable posture on a square stone, violently gesticulating
with her fourteen arms, perhaps at a party of heretical Bhootyas who
were passing tranquilly by, leading along their sheep, decidedly the
cleanest and most respectable-looking members of the group.&nbsp; Beyond,
high and gloomy houses almost touched, their wooden fringes creaking
responsively to one another across the narrow streets, while the owners
of the cobwebby tenements, peeping out of the narrow windows in their
balconies, made their remarks upon the strangers in not much more melodious
tones; in an old court-yard a little way above, was visible an unwieldy
rhinoceros, placidly contemplating a bundle of grass, from which it
had satisfied its hunger, in happy ignorance that its life is dependent
on that of the Rajah; for in Nepaul it is a rule that the death of one
great animal should be immediately followed by that of another, and,
when a Rajah dies, a rhinoceros is forthwith killed to keep him company.&nbsp;
As he stood tethered almost under the palace windows, we thought him
at once a fitting moral and a characteristic background to this novel
and interesting picture.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p><i>The temple of Sumboonath&mdash;View from the platform of the temple&mdash;The
valley of Nepaul and its resources&mdash;Tradition respecting it&mdash;Entrance
of the Prime Minister into Katmandu&mdash;The two kings&mdash;A brilliant
reception</i>.</p>
<p>The temple of Sumboonath, which we next visited, is situated on the
summit of a woody eminence; it is approached by a long flight of steps,
the trouble of ascending which is amply compensated by the lovely view
which the platform of the temple commands, as well as by an inspection
of the curious construction of the building itself.</p>
<p>Sumboonath is looked upon as one of the oldest temples in Nepaul,
and was erected, according to Kirkpatrick, when Nepaul was ruled by
a race of Thibetians; its possession was at one time claimed by the
Dalai Lama, or Sovereign Pontiff of H&rsquo;Lassa, but he has since
been obliged to abandon the claim.</p>
<p>The Dagoba resembles the temple of Bhood, but is only about half
its size; the spire is covered with plates of copper, gilt.&nbsp; It
is surrounded by pagodas, as well as numerous more modern shrines of
a bastard Hindoo class, to which Bhootyas and Bhamas, a tribe of Newars,
resort in great numbers.&nbsp; Occasionally the Ghorkas visit these
shrines; the thunderbolt of Indra, which is here exhibited, being, I
suppose, the object of attraction to them, as they pride themselves
on being orthodox Hindoos.</p>
<p>This collection of temples is surrounded by rickety old houses, inhabited
by Bhootyas and priests.&nbsp; All around small images sit upon wet
stones, holding in their hands everlasting tapers, and look out of their
niches upon the dirty worshippers who smother them with faded flowers.&nbsp;
Turning our backs upon these little divinities, we obtained the first
panoramic view we had yet had of the valley and city of Katmandu.</p>
<p>The valley is of an oval shape; its circumference is nearly 50 miles,
and the hills by which it is enclosed vary from one to two thousand
feet in height.&nbsp; Sheopoorie, the most lofty of these, is clothed
to the summit with evergreen jungle, and rises abruptly behind the town.&nbsp;
Behind it the fantastically shaped Jib Jibia shows its craggy summit
thickly powdered with snow, while the still loftier Gosain-Than, at
a distance of about 30 miles, rears its ever white and glittering peak
to a height of 25,000 feet, and seems majestically to preside over this
glorious scene.</p>
<p>The town of Katmandu, situated at the junction of the Bhagmutty and
Bishmutty, and containing a population of 50,000 inhabitants, lay spread
at our feet, and we could discern the passengers on the narrow fragile-looking
bridges which span the two rivers, at this time containing scarcely
any water.&nbsp; Innumerable temples, Bhuddist and Hindoo, and mixtures
of both, occupied hillocks, or were situated near the sacred fonts or
groves with which the valley abounds, and which adds much to the beauty
of its appearance.&nbsp; The number of the edifices affords strong proof
of the superstition of the people, and warrants the remark of Colonel
Kirkpatrick, who says that there seem to be in Nepaul as many shrines
as houses, and as many idols as inhabitants.</p>
<p>A tradition is current in Nepaul that the valley of Katmandu was
at some former period a lake, and it is difficult to say in which character
it would have appeared the most beautiful.&nbsp; The knolls, wooded
or terraced, with romantic old Newar towns crowning their summits,&mdash;the
five rivers of the valley winding amongst verdant meadows,&mdash;the
banks here and there precipitous, where the soft clayey soil had yielded
to the action of the torrent in the rains,&mdash;the glittering city
itself,&mdash;the narrow paved ways leading between high hedges of prickly
pear,&mdash;the pagodas and temples studded in all directions, presented
a scene as picturesque and perhaps more interesting than would have
been afforded by the still lake embedded in wild mountains, and frowned
upon by snow-capped peaks; while the richly cultivated knolls in the
valley formed fertile islands, the luxuriant vegetation of which would
have softened the scene into one of exquisite beauty.</p>
<p>Whether the rich and wonderfully prolific soil of the valley is the
alluvial deposit of this lake, I cannot say, but there is no doubt that,
whatever may be the cause, the valley of Nepaul is almost unrivalled
in its fertility, supporting as it does in comfort and plenty a population
of 400,000 inhabitants, being 300 persons to the square mile.</p>
<p>There is not, I conceive, any other mountainous country in the world
that can boast of possessing so favoured a spot.&nbsp; Throughout its
whole length and breadth, not a stone is to be found: it is well watered;
its temperature is delightful, the thermometer in the hottest month
seldom reaches 75&deg;, in the coldest never falls below 30&deg;; it
is sufficiently near the tropics to rejoice in the presence of the warm
bright sun even in the depth of winter, while the proximity of the ever
snow-capped &ldquo;Himaleh&rdquo; prevents the heat being too severely
felt in the middle of summer.&nbsp; It rarely freezes in the valley,
and never snows, although the hills around, some of which do not exceed
1000 feet, are frequently powdered.</p>
<p>It is impossible to conceive a more enjoyable climate, and the numerous
productions of which the valley can boast betoken its genial influences.</p>
<p>I am sorry that I cannot from my own observation testify to the rich
variety of its vegetable productions, as the time of year during which
I was in Nepaul was unfavourable, but many English forest-trees flourish
here,&mdash;amongst them, oaks, chestnuts, and pines; rhododendrons
also abound, and I observed almost every species of English fruit-tree:
in the residency garden all the European vegetables are raised to perfection.</p>
<p>But to return from this digression on the advantages of soil and
climate which the valley possesses.&nbsp; The lovely view before us
comprised in a glance the grand and majestic scenery of the mountains,
with the softer but still animating view of the luxuriant plain, bearing
evidence of that large and industrious population whose habitations
were so picturesquely grouped throughout it.</p>
<p>We had not nearly satisfied our desire to gaze upon so much that
was new and interesting, when we were informed by our attendants that
the astrologers had announced the auspicious moment at which the Minister
Sahib, or, as we must now call him, Jung Bahadoor Comaranagee, should
leave the camp outside the city walls and make an imposing entry into
Katmandu.</p>
<p>This lucky hour was now close at hand; and as the entrance of the
prime minister into the capital was a scene not to be lost, we hurried
down to be in time for the ceremony of his reception.</p>
<p>In a few moments we were rattling in one of the only carriages in
Nepaul over one of the only carriage-roads of which it can boast, and
soon reached the bridge, near which was pitched a spacious tent.&nbsp;
On our way we passed a square lined with soldiers, and the streets were
crowded with a motley population, such as it would be vain to endeavour
to describe, but which increased in density as we approached the centre
of attraction, near which we were obliged to leave the carriage, and
were conducted between rows of soldiers by various members of the royal
household, each of us being led by the hand in the most affectionate
manner.&nbsp; My conductor was a brother of Jung Bahadoor&rsquo;s, who
distinguished himself about a week afterwards by a base attempt to assassinate
the minister.&nbsp; I was unfortunate in my friends in other instances
besides this: one old man, who had accompanied the minister to Europe,
and was an especial ally of mine on board ship, was implicated in the
same vile plot against the life of the man towards whom he had every
reason to feel gratitude, if such a sentiment is known amongst Orientals.&nbsp;
Poor old Kurbeer Kutrie was a venerable-looking dignified old man, bigoted
to an excess, and thoroughly disgusted with his trip to the land of
the beef-eaters, though he could not but admit that what he saw was
wonderful!&nbsp; The ignominious punishment which was inflicted upon
him for his share in the conspiracy, and by which he lost caste, was
doubtless more severely felt by him than death would have been.&nbsp;
Not that it signifies in the least in Nepaul whether a man is a fratricide
or prefers making away with more distant relatives.&nbsp; If you do
not associate with assassins, you must give up the pleasures of Nepaul
society.&nbsp; Among the natives assassination is not looked upon as
a crime, but as a matter of course; the minister, however, with those
of his suite who accompanied him on his recent mission, have become
more enlightened in this respect, and have found to their astonishment
that indiscriminate murder is not the usual mode adopted in the civilized
world for bringing about political changes or accomplishing private
ends.</p>
<p>Jung Bahadoor, no doubt, now wishes that more of the Durbar had made
the same trip, and profited by it in like manner, since the custom above
alluded to must be highly inconvenient to him, more particularly since
he has eight brothers, most of whom cast a longing eye towards the premiership;
a man&rsquo;s chance of filling this office not depending upon his power
&ldquo;to form a ministry,&rdquo; so much as upon his accuracy in taking
aim and his skill in seizing any opportunity offered by his rival of
showing his dexterity in a manner more personal than pleasant.&nbsp;
Jung Bahadoor may well exclaim, &ldquo;Save me from my brothers!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Already has one of them attempted his life; but the Minister has learned
mercy in England, and, to the astonishment of every one, Budreenath
Sing and his fellow conspirators are only banished for life.&nbsp; It
is said that the minister resisted all the representations of his friends
as to the propriety of executing the conspirators, by the argument of
&ldquo;What would the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; say?&rdquo;&mdash;which must
have appeared to the majority of the members of the Nepaul Durbar to
be a very extraordinary reason for leniency.</p>
<p>Bum Bahadoor had acted as prime minister during the absence of his
brother in England, and had just learnt to value the possession of power
when the return of the minister put an end to his short-lived greatness,
and he would have sunk at once into comparative insignificance, had
not Jung, who knew enough of human nature to guess the sentiments of
a man in such a position, judiciously gilded the pill by making him
Commander-in-Chief of the Forces.</p>
<p>Grasping the friendly hand of my conductor, in happy ignorance of
his fratricidal intentions, I followed immediately behind the Minister,
whose return to Nepaul, after he had encountered the perils of land
and sea, and paid a visit to the Queen of the greatest country in the
world, not even excepting China, was a matter of so much importance,
that the Rajah himself came from his palace to the spot where we were
now assembled, to meet one who had been favoured with an interview with
so mighty a monarch, and who had in his possession the letter from her
majesty of England to his majesty of Nepaul.&nbsp; We were, therefore,
prepared to see the king seated on a divan, and arrayed in gorgeous
attire; but who the old gentleman was who was sitting with most perfect
sang froid next him on his elevated seat, I was at a loss to conceive.&nbsp;
Whoever he was, he seemed most perfectly at home, and I found on inquiry
it was natural he should be so, for the old man was sitting on his own
throne, which had been usurped by his son, he having been dethroned
on the score of imbecility.&nbsp; Such being the case, why he was allowed
to occupy the place he did was inexplicable, unless it were to prove
that he really was unfit to sit upon the throne alone, since he was
content to share it upon grand occasions with his son, whenever this
latter precocious young gentleman, who was, as it were, the representative
of &ldquo;Young Nepaul,&rdquo; chose to give his venerable father a
treat.</p>
<p>But it would be useless to speculate on the cause of this proceeding,
since it is impossible ever to understand, and hopeless to attempt to
discover, the motives or secret springs which actuate a native Durbar;
and no doubt Jung himself, who is the real manager of everything, had
some good reason for the present double occupancy of the throne.&nbsp;
It struck me that it would answer one purpose at any rate: it would
show the people that the young king looked as imbecile as the old one,
while his countenance was far less prepossessing, as he seemed only
to have just sense enough to be able to gratify the brutal and sensual
passions to which he is a prey; whether the stories of wholesale executions
of slaves taking place in his court-yard merely for his amusement are
true or not, I cannot say, but he looked capable of any wickedness,
and, though not more than twenty-two or twenty-three years old, had
already rivalled the atrocities of Nero.&nbsp; His countenance was not
unlike those depicted on the walls of Indian towns, with the same large
staring eyes, thin twisted moustache, sensual lips, and thick bull neck.&nbsp;
His dress was handsome, and his jewels were magnificent; but in dress,
in carriage, and in dignity of manner, the prime minister was unquestionably
the most distinguished-looking man in Durbar.&nbsp; He wore a magnificent
robe of white silk embroidered with gold, and tight pantaloons of rich
brocade, which set off his slim figure to advantage; his turban was
a mass of sparkling diamonds, and his whole person seemed loaded with
jewels.&nbsp; His sturdy body-guard, all armed with double-barrelled
rifles, stood close behind his chair, and were the only soldiers in
the tent; the nonchalant way in which he addressed the rajah, with folded
arms and unbended knee, betokened the unbounded power he possesses in
the state.&nbsp; Perhaps it is not very politic in him to arrogate so
much to himself in a land where every man&rsquo;s hand is against him,
in proportion as he is feared by every one from his majesty downwards.</p>
<p>On each side of the tent stood a row of grandees of the realm, amongst
whom the eight brothers of Jung Bahadoor held conspicuous places, while
kasies and sirdars continued the line, until they were lost in the crowd
of minor officers.</p>
<p>The blaze of jewels, and the glitter of gold and silver, were calculated
to strike an European spectator with astonishment, and he might well
be startled at so magnificent a display in a highland court.</p>
<p>I observed a few English and French uniforms, covered with a great
deal more of gold and silver lace than they were entitled to; all which
gaudy array was the more striking to me when I remembered that I had
on a plaid shooting-coat and felt hat.&nbsp; I had no opportunity of
explaining to his majesty that plaid shooting-coats and felt hats are
the court costume in England, but no doubt he thought it all correct.&nbsp;
It is, moreover, the prerogative of Englishmen to sit in the presence
of Oriental potentates with their hats on, which prevented my secreting
my shabby old wide-awake as I had intended.</p>
<p>As I sat next but one to the minister, I was under the immediate
protection of the rifles and pistols, which latter implements protruded
in a most formidable manner from the belts of the body-guard.&nbsp;
As various Nepaulese nobles of doubtful politics sat in front of his
Excellency, he felt these gentlemen-at-arms were peculiarly valuable
additions to his retinue, as being ready to act either on the offensive
or defensive at a moment&rsquo;s notice.&nbsp; Everything, however,
went off with the most perfect harmony; a few compliments were exchanged
between himself and his sovereign, and the meeting broke up after the
usual ceremony of giving and receiving pawn.&nbsp; This consisted in
the presentation by both the kings, to every stranger present, of a
small pyramidal packet of leaves, which, when opened by the favoured
recipient, was found to contain a few other leaves, stuck together by
slimy substances, of unpleasant appearance and aromatic odour.&nbsp;
Fortunately, you were not compelled to partake of this in the presence
of the royal donor, and means were found to dispose of it slily on leaving
his majesty&rsquo;s audience-chamber.</p>
<p>As we were driving back to the Residency, it struck me that the history
of a man who, at so early an age, had raised himself from being an ensign
in the army to the powerful position which the grand display at his
reception had just proved him to hold in his own country, would be interesting,
if it were possible to gain any information on the subject that could
be relied upon.&nbsp; I therefore determined to collect the best that
it was in my power to obtain; and the following particulars, gathered
partly from himself, and partly from one who has had many opportunities
of becoming acquainted with his history, form, I believe, a trustworthy
account of a career which, from its tragic nature, is invested with
a thrilling interest, while it faithfully portrays the eventful changes
usually attending the life of an Oriental statesman.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p><i>Sketch of the career of His Excellency General Jung Bahadoor,
Prime Minister of Nepaul</i>.</p>
<p>It will be necessary before commencing an account of the career of
Jung Bahadoor to describe the state in which the political affairs of
Nepaul were when his ambition and daring prompted him to play so important
a part in its government.&nbsp; Cool, courageous, and an adept in all
arts of intrigue, he possessed every qualification necessary to render
a man successful in the East, where native courts are incessantly torn
asunder by rival factions, and scenes of violence and bloodshed are
the result of plots and counterplots, as each party becomes for the
time predominant, and its leading man assumes the office of premier,
to be soon after deprived of his short-lived greatness by a successful
conspiracy of the opposing party.&nbsp; These in their turn share the
same fate, the King and country remaining passive spectators of the
struggles between the opposing factions.&nbsp; They are indeed uninteresting
to the King, for he is only too delighted to get any one to take the
cares of government off his shoulders, and considers his prerogative
to consist in enjoying himself as much as possible.&nbsp; They are equally
uninteresting to the country, for these violent dissensions do not arise
upon questions of policy, in any way affecting its government.&nbsp;
Ministerial explanations are never asked for nor given in the East.&nbsp;
The power of the prime minister is absolute till he is shot, when it
becomes unnecessary to question the expediency of his measures, and
the people are only interested to this extent, that, generally speaking,
the longer a premier can maintain his position, by so much is their
prosperity increased.</p>
<p>The two rival factions in Nepaul were the Pandees and Thapas, and
in the early part of this century the reins of government were held
by one of the most enlightened men that ever attained to the position
of prime minister.&nbsp; Bheem Singh Thapa has left behind him numerous
monuments of his greatness, calculating, like Napoleon, that his fame
would last at least as long as they did.&nbsp; For an unusual number
of years did this able minister retain the management of affairs.&nbsp;
He was ultimately placed in confinement, on the charge of being accessory
to the murder of the Rajah&rsquo;s children by poison.&nbsp; His enemies
resorted to an ingenious, though cruel device, to rid themselves altogether
of so dreaded a rival.&nbsp; Knowing his high spirit and keen sense
of honour, they spread the report that the sanctity of his Zenana had
been violated by the soldiery, which so exasperated him that he committed
suicide, and was found in his cell with his throat cut from ear to ear;
this occurred in the year 1839.&nbsp; His property was of course confiscated,
and the greater part of his family banished.&nbsp; His successor, Ram
Singh Pandee, did not long enjoy his ill-gotten power, for, having been
discovered intriguing against the British with the ministers of other
native courts, he was removed at the representations of our government.&nbsp;
Mahtabar Singh, a nephew of the former prime minister, Bheem Singh Thapa,
had meantime ingratiated himself with the Ranee (Queen), and through
her influence succeeded in getting himself appointed to the vacant post
of premier&mdash;when, as was to be expected, his first act was to decapitate
his predecessor, and as many of the Pandee&rsquo;s family as possible.</p>
<p>The brother of Mahtabar Singh was a kazi, commanding a portion of
the army stationed on the north-west frontier of Nepaul, and the second
of his eight sons was Jung Bahadoor, then a subadar, or ensign.&nbsp;
The independent spirit which the young man had manifested from a boy
led him into frequent scrapes with the old kazi, and he used to escape
the punishments which they entailed by absconding altogether, and remaining
absent until he thought his father&rsquo;s wrath had subsided, or until,
as was oftener the case, his own resources were expended.&nbsp; These,
however, he usually found means to replenish by his expertness at all
games of chance with cards and dice, and early in life he became an
accomplished gambler.&nbsp; He was moreover a great favourite amongst
the soldiers, as well from his readiness to join them in any wild scheme,
as from his skill in all manly exercises and accomplishments.&nbsp;
At last the young officer, impatient of being under command, decided
upon a bolder step than a mere temporary absence without leave, and
thinking, no doubt, that it was a duty he owed to society to improve
himself as much as possible by seeing the world, he walked across the
Nepaul frontier into Upper India, and profitably employed his time by
turning his powers of observation to account, thereby gaining considerable
insight into the mode of government and resources of our Indian possessions.</p>
<p>After a time his own resources became so greatly diminished that
he was obliged to return, trusting to his powers of acting the repentant
prodigal to avert the torrent of his father&rsquo;s wrath.&nbsp; The
breach of discipline which he had committed was as readily overlooked
in Nepaul as it would have been in other more civilised countries, when
the offender has good interest to back him; and promotion to the command
of a company was given him as the reward of his services while ensign.&nbsp;
About this period Jung Bahadoor received the intelligence of the advancement
of his uncle, Mahtabar Singh, to the office of prime minister.&nbsp;
So fine a chance for an adventurous spirit to push his fortune at court
was not to be lost, and once more bidding adieu to the dull out-station
at which he was posted, to the constraint of discipline and to the grumblings
of the old martinet, his father, he followed the example of many great
men before him, and betook himself to the capital, thinking it the only
place in which his talents could be appreciated.&nbsp; Here he possessed
frequent opportunities of displaying that aptitude for intrigue to which
he mainly owes his present position, coupled as it was with a daring
that hesitated not at the performance of any act which his keen perception
and subtle understanding pointed out as necessary for the advancement
of his own interests.&nbsp; Jung soon after accompanied a secret mission
to Benares, to meet one from the north-west, with the view of organising
a war against the British.&nbsp; The vigilance of our authorities, however,
discovered the existence of this conspiracy, and Jung, together with
his compatriots, was ignominiously taken back to his own frontier, and
there liberated.&nbsp; On his return to the capital he led much the
same life as before, dabbling not a little in politics; and the ambitious
views which now began to actuate him rendered him obnoxious to the young
prince, then a mere boy of eighteen, who, nevertheless, seemed to share
with his father a portion of the executive.&nbsp; Indeed it was difficult
to say in whom the sovereign authority rested; for the Ranee, or wife
of the old King, had, with the assistance of Mahtabar Singh, the prime
minister, gained a great influence over the mind of the monarch, who
seems to have become nearly imbecile.</p>
<p>It was perhaps the near relationship of Jung to the Prime Minister
that brought upon him the ill-will of the Prince, who treated him with
the most unmitigated animosity, and used every means in his power surreptitiously
to destroy him.&nbsp; On one occasion he ordered him to cross a flooded
mountain torrent on horseback, and when he had reached the middle of
the current, which was so furiously rapid that his horse could with
difficulty keep his footing, the young Prince suddenly called him back,
hoping that, in the act of turning, the force of the stream would overpower
both horse and rider.&nbsp; This danger Jung escaped, owing to his great
nerve and presence of mind.&nbsp; In relating this anecdote he seemed
to think that his life had been in more imminent peril than on any other
occasion; though the following struck me as being a much more hazardous
exploit.&nbsp; After the affair of the torrent the Prince was no longer
at any pains to conceal his designs upon the life of the young adventurer,
and that life being of no particular value to any one but Jung himself,
it was a matter of perfect indifference to anybody and everybody whether
the Prince amused himself by sacrificing Jung to his own dislikes or
not.&nbsp; It is by no means an uncommon mode of execution in Nepaul
to throw the unfortunate victim down a well: Jung had often thought
that it was entirely the fault of the aforesaid victim if he did not
come up again alive and unhurt.&nbsp; In order to prove the matter satisfactorily,
and also be prepared for any case of future emergency, he practised
the art of jumping down wells, and finally perfected himself therein.&nbsp;
When, therefore, he heard that it was the intention of the Prince to
throw him down a well, he was in no way dismayed, and only made one
last request, in a very desponding tone, which was, that an exception
might be made in his favour as regarded the being cast down, and that
he might be permitted to throw himself down.&nbsp; This was so reasonable
a request that it was at once granted; and, surrounded by a large concourse
of people&mdash;the Prince himself being present by way of a morning&rsquo;s
recreation&mdash;Jung repaired to the well, where, divesting himself
of all superfluous articles of clothing, and looking very much as if
he were bidding adieu for ever to the happy valley of Nepaul, he crossed
his legs, and, jumping boldly down, was lost to the view of the prince
and nobles, a dull splash alone testifying to his arrival at the bottom.&nbsp;
Fortunately for Jung there was plenty of water&mdash;a fact of which
most probably he was well aware&mdash;and there were, moreover, many
chinks and crannies in the porous stone of which the well was built;
so, having learnt his lesson, Jung clung dextrously to the side of the
well until midnight, when his friends, who had been previously apprized
of the part they were to perform, came and rescued him from his uncomfortable
position, and secreted him until affairs took such a turn as rendered
it safe for Jung Bahadoor to resuscitate himself.&nbsp; Such was the
adventure of the well, which, marvellous as it may appear, was gravely
related to me by his Excellency, who would have been very much scandalised
if I had doubted it, which of course I did not.</p>
<p>While in a story-telling mood, I may as well relate an account that
was given me of the manner in which Jung distinguished himself on one
occasion with a musk elephant.&nbsp; The story is interesting, as it
was by such daring feats that he won for himself the reputation of being
the most undaunted sportsman in Nepaul.&nbsp; The elephant in question
had been for some time the terror of the neighbourhood, nor was any
one found hardy enough to attempt the capture of the rabid monster.&nbsp;
At last, so notorious became his destruction of life and property that
Jung heard of it, and at once determined to encounter him.&nbsp; The
animal was in the habit of passing along the narrow street of a village
in the course of his nocturnal depredations.&nbsp; One night Jung posted
himself on the roof of a low outhouse, and, as the huge brute walked
under the roof, made a vigorous leap, which landed him on the neck of
the elephant, and, in spite of all the efforts of the infuriated animal,
there he maintained his position until he succeeded in blindfolding
him with a cloth, and in securing him to a tree, amidst the shouts of
the populace.&nbsp; Lest this story should seem too improbable to be
credited, it may be remarked that a musk elephant is often, as was the
case in this instance, a tame one, which at a particular season becomes
rabid, and, breaking loose, is the terror of the neighbourhood until
recaptured.</p>
<p>During this eventful period in Jung Bahadoor&rsquo;s life, his uncle,
Mahtabar Singh, continued to administer the affairs of government with
tolerable success; but the Ranee, to whom he was beholden for the position
he occupied, turned the influence she had thus obtained over him to
a bad account, and this gallant soldier and popular minister ultimately
became distrusted and feared by his own friends, with whom the Ranee
was no favourite.&nbsp; This unprincipled woman ill repaid the devotion
of her minister, for, on his refusing to comply with her request that
he should put to death some of her personal enemies, she became at once
his implacable foe, and ruthlessly resolved upon the destruction of
her hitherto devoted ally.&nbsp; Thus Mahtabar Singh found himself alienated
from and distrusted by his own faction, while he was abandoned by his
former patroness, for whose favour he had sacrificed their adherence.&nbsp;
The Ranee did not hesitate to apply to this very party for assistance
in the furtherance of her nefarious design, and the prime minister was
doomed to fall a victim to his own indecision by the hands of his favourite
nephew.</p>
<p>One night, about eleven o&rsquo;clock, a messenger came from the
palace to inform him that his services were required by their Majesties&mdash;for
the Queen had always kept up a semblance of friendship with him.&nbsp;
Without the slightest suspicion he repaired to the palace, but scarcely
had he ascended the great staircase, and was entering the room in which
their Majesties were seated, when the report of a pistol rung through
the room; the fatal bullet pierced the heart of the gallant old man,
who staggered forward, and fell at the feet of the wretched woman who
had been the instigator of the cruel murder.</p>
<p>It is difficult to say what were the motives that prompted Jung Bahadoor
to the perpetration of this detestable act, of which he always speaks
now in terms of the deepest regret, but asserts that it was an act of
necessity, from which there was no escaping.&nbsp; The plea which he
invariably uses when referring to the catastrophe is, that either his
life or his uncle&rsquo;s must have been sacrificed, and he naturally
preferred that it should be the latter.&nbsp; However that may be, the
immediate effect was, the formation of a new ministry, in which Jung
held office in the capacity of commander-in-chief.&nbsp; The premier,
Guggun Singh, was associated with two colleagues.&nbsp; A year had hardly
elapsed before Guggun Singh was shot while sitting in his own room.&nbsp;
This occurred in the year 1846; a sirdar was taken up on suspicion of
having committed this murder, and Abiman Singh, one of the premier&rsquo;s
colleagues, was ordered by the Queen to put him to death; as, however,
the Rajah would not sanction the execution, Abiman Singh refused to
obey the command&mdash;a proceeding on his part which seems to have
raised a suspicion in the mind of Jung that he had been concerned in
the assassination.&nbsp; This suspicion he communicated to Futteh Jung,
the other colleague of the late prime minister, suggesting that Abiman
Singh and the sirdar already in custody should be forthwith executed,
and Futteh Jung installed as prime minister.&nbsp; Futteh Jung, however,
refused to accede to so strong a measure; and Jung, who was not of a
nature to be thwarted in his plans, determined upon temporarily depriving
him of his liberty, in order to enable him to put the design into execution
himself.</p>
<p>He had no sooner decided upon his line of conduct than he displayed
the utmost resolution in carrying it out.&nbsp; On the same night, and
while at the palace, the suspicions which Jung already entertained were
confirmed by his observing that Abiman Singh ordered his men to load.&nbsp;
It was no time for hesitation.&nbsp; The two colleagues, with many of
their adherents, were assembled in the large hall, where the Queen,
in a highly-excited state, was insisting upon an immediate disclosure
of the murderer of Guggun Singh, who was supposed to have been her paramour.&nbsp;
At this moment Jung gave the signal for the seizure of Futteh Jung.&nbsp;
The attempt was no sooner made than his son, Karak Bikram Sah, imagining
that his father&rsquo;s life was at stake, rushed forward to save him,
and seizing a kukri, had already dealt Bum Bahadoor a severe blow, when
he was cut down by Dere Shum Shere Bahadoor, then a youth of sixteen
or seventeen.</p>
<p>Futteh Jung, vowing vengeance on the murderers of his son, sprang
forward to avenge his death, and in another moment Bum Bahadoor, already
seriously wounded, would have fallen at his feet, when the report of
a rifle rang through the hall, and the timely bullet sped by the hand
of Jung Bahadoor laid the gallant father by the side of his no less
gallant son.</p>
<p>Thus Jung&rsquo;s <i>coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat</i> had taken rather
a different turn from what he had intended; the die, however, was cast,
and everything depended upon his coolness and decision in the trying
circumstances in which he was placed.&nbsp; Though he may have felt
that his life was in most imminent peril, it is difficult to conceive
how any man could attain to such a pitch of cool desperation as to enact
the scene which closed this frightful tragedy.&nbsp; There still confronted
him fourteen of the nobles whose leader had been slain before their
eyes, and who thirsted for vengeance; but the appearance at his side
of that faithful body-guard, on whose fidelity the safety of the minister
has more than once depended, precluded them from seizing the murderer
of their chief.&nbsp; It was but too clear to those unhappy men what
was to be the last act of this tragedy.&nbsp; Jung received the rifle
from the hand of the man next him, and levelled it at the foremost of
the little band.&nbsp; Fourteen times did that fatal report ring through
the hall as one by one the rifles were handed to one who would trust
no eye but his own, and at each shot another noble lay stretched on
the ground.&nbsp; Abiman Singh alone escaped the deadly aim; he managed
to reach the door, but there he was cut almost in two by the sword of
Krishn Bahadoor.</p>
<p>Thus, in a few moments, and by his own hand, had Jung rid himself
of those whom he most feared.&nbsp; In that one room lay the corpses
of the highest nobles of the land, shrouded by the dense smoke still
hanging in the confined atmosphere, as if to hide the horrors of a tragedy
that would not bear the light of day.&nbsp; The massacre now went on
in all parts of the building.&nbsp; One hundred and fifty sirdars perished
on that eventful night, and the panic was wide-spread and general.&nbsp;
Before day had dawned Jung Bahadoor had been appointed prime minister
of Nepaul, and had placed guards over the arsenal, treasury, and palace.</p>
<p>In the morning the troops were all drawn up on parade; before them
were placed, in a ghastly heap, the bodies of their late commanders,
to which Jung pointed, as he assured the army that it would find in
him all that it had ever found in them, and he consoled many of the
officers in a great measure for the loss they had just sustained by
granting them immediate promotion.&nbsp; It seems as easy for a daring
adventurer to gain the affections of an army in India as in Europe,
and Jung found no difficulty in reconciling his Ghorkas to a change
of commanders, and they have ever since professed the greatest devotion
to his person.</p>
<p>The utmost caution was now necessary on the part of the new premier,
who was obliged still to be on his guard, lest the partisans of those
whom he had massacred should succeed in organizing a conspiracy against
his life; a sirdar was put to death simply because he had a private
audience with the King.&nbsp; Circumstances soon showed that Jung had
good reason to feel the insecurity of his position.&nbsp; The two elder
Princes, sons of a former Queen, had been for some time in confinement,
and the Ranee now attempted to induce Jung to put them to death, in
order to secure the throne for one of her own sons.&nbsp; This he positively
refused to do, and his refusal brought upon him the wrath of this vindictive
woman, whose vengeance had already been so signally wreaked on his uncle
by his own instrumentality.</p>
<p>He had not played so prominent a part on that occasion without profiting
by the lesson he had learnt; and knowing well the character of the woman
with whom he had to deal, he took care to obtain accurate intelligence
of all that transpired at court.</p>
<p>Information soon reached him that a plot was formed against his life,
and that the post of premier had already been promised to his intended
murderer, as a reward for so dangerous a service.&nbsp; Once more the
command, which had proved so fatal to Mahtabar Singh, issued from the
palace, desiring the immediate attendance of the minister; the messenger
was the very man at whose hand Jung was to meet his doom.&nbsp; He had
scarcely delivered his treacherous message, when he was struck to the
ground by one of the attendants of the prime minister.&nbsp; Jung then
proceeded on his way to the palace, where he at once demanded of the
Rajah to be dismissed from office, or to be furnished with authority
to order the destruction of all the enemies of the heir-apparent.&nbsp;
The King could not refuse to grant the authority demanded; and it was
no sooner granted than Jung seized and beheaded all the adherents of
the conspirator.</p>
<p>As the Ranee herself was the most inveterate enemy of the young Prince,
the Rajah&rsquo;s order was at once carried into effect against her,
and, to her infinite astonishment, she was informed by Jung that she
was to leave Nepaul immediately, accompanied by her two sons.&nbsp;
It was of no use to resist the successful young adventurer, whose indomitable
courage and good fortune had triumphed over the plots and intrigues
of his enemies, and who thus saw himself freed from every obstacle to
his quiet possession of the government.</p>
<p>The Rajah accompanied the Queen to Benares.&nbsp; Meantime the heir-apparent
was raised to the throne, and the whole administrative power vested
in his minister.</p>
<p>Upon hearing of the installation of his son as Rajah, the old Monarch
seemed to evince, for the first and last time in his life, some little
interest in proceedings by which he himself was so seriously affected,
and the result was a feeble determination not to relinquish his throne
without a final struggle.&nbsp; Urged to this course probably by the
persuasions of the ambitious and disappointed Ranee, he collected a
few followers, and crossed the southern frontier of Nepaul.&nbsp; Jung,
however, had received timely notice of his intention, and the luckless
King had no sooner encamped in the Nepaul dominions, than he was surprised
at night by the troops of the minister, and his small forces utterly
routed, four or five hundred remaining killed or wounded upon the field.&nbsp;
The Rajah himself was taken prisoner, and placed in confinement by the
dutiful son who now occupies the throne, and who sometimes allows him,
on grand occasions, to take his seat upon it next to himself.</p>
<p>The vacillating conduct of the imbecile old man throughout his whole
reign, the apathy with which he was contented to remain a passive spectator
of those bloody dramas of which his court was for so long a period the
theatre, deprive him of all claim to commiseration in his present degraded
position, which, in fact, is the natural result of his indifference
to the game so eagerly played by the contending parties, and of which
the stake was his own throne.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, in a country where common humanity, and, still
more, every kind of principle, is unknown, daring and intrepid conduct
merits a reward, Jung has fairly earned for himself the position he
now holds; and though his path to greatness has been deluged with the
blood of the bravest nobles of the land, it must be admitted that the
peace and prosperity which Nepaul now enjoys would never have been possessed
by her while distracted and convulsed by the struggles of hostile factions;
and much less would she ever have experienced the blessings of an enlightened
administration, if these struggles had not resulted in the elevation
of General Jung Bahadoor to the office of prime minister.</p>
<p>And now, for the first time in the history of Nepaul, the Durbar
was to a certain extent united; internal machinations were no longer
to be feared; and the country was ruled over by different members of
that family, the elevation of which was due to one of their own number,
who possessed sufficient daring and resolution to execute the bold,
though unscrupulous schemes his undoubted genius had conceived.</p>
<p>Such was the rapid rise to power at the early age of thirty of General
Jung Bahadoor, the Nepaulese ambassador to England, who would have been
invested with a deeper interest than the mere colour of his face or
brilliancy of his diamonds entitled him to, had the British public known
the foregoing particulars of his eventful career.&nbsp; But, perhaps,
it was as well for him that they did not, since our occidental notions
as to the legitimate method of carrying political measures might have
altogether excluded him from the favour of those who delighted to honour
him during his visit to England; but, in extenuation of his conduct,
it must be remembered that the mode employed by him of gaining power
is the common one in his country, and that his early training had induced
a disregard of life and recklessness of consequences; for he is not,
I am convinced, naturally cruel.&nbsp; Impetuous and thoughtless, he
has many generous and noble qualities; and in a companionship of two
months I discovered so many estimable traits in him, that I could not
help making allowances for the defects in a character entirely self-formed
by one ignorant of all moral responsibilities, the half-tamed son of
an almost totally uncivilised country.</p>
<p>And while thus unreservedly relating his history, I do so in the
belief that he has no desire to conceal what, in his own mind and that
of his countrymen, is not regarded as crime, since I have frequently
heard him refer, with all the simplicity of conscious innocence, to
many of the facts I have related, and for some of which he himself is
my authority.</p>
<p>Having thus given a short account of the previous career of this
remarkable man, a few words on his present position and future prospects
may not be uninteresting, the more so as he purposes, since he has visited
the courts of Europe, to become an enlightened ruler of his countrymen.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<p><i>The titles of his Excellency General Jung Bahadoor Coomaranagee
in England&mdash;Extraordinary notions of the British public on Indian
affairs&mdash;Jung Bahadoor&rsquo;s conciliatory policy&mdash;Our unsuccessful
attempt to penetrate beyond the permitted boundaries&mdash;Dangerous
position of the Prime Minister&mdash;His philanthropic designs&mdash;Great
opposition on the part of Durbar&mdash;Native punishments&mdash;A Nepaulese
chief-justice&mdash;Jung&rsquo;s popularity with the peasantry and army</i>.</p>
<p>The rumours in England during Jung Bahadoor&rsquo;s short residence
there&mdash;of who he was, of what position he held, of his having taken
his greatest enemies with him to keep them from conspiring against him
while absent&mdash;of his being at least a Prince, if not the Rajah
himself in disguise&mdash;were as far from correct, and as improbable,
as were the numerous stories related of him in the newspapers, many
of which had no foundation whatever, and in no way redounded to his
credit.</p>
<p>The subject, however, of so much speculation was generally too much
pleased with his notoriety to care for the means which in some measure
obtained it for him; and I have heard him repeat with great glee some
imaginary anecdote of himself, or laughingly enumerate the various appellations
by which he had been known.&nbsp; Amongst the few words of English which
he could pronounce were those by which he was most frequently addressed&mdash;such
as, the Prince, the Ambassador, your Highness, your Excellency, the
Minister, Jung Bahadoor, Jung, or more often &ldquo;the Jung.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Whilst the appearance of the Coomaranagee Polkas showed an unusual amount
of correct information on the part of the publisher.</p>
<p>Such ignorance might have been expected from the utter indifference
manifested in England towards Indian affairs.&nbsp; The ideas of John
Bull upon the subject are often ludicrous in the extreme, as he finds
it impossible to divest himself of the preconceived notions which he
surely must have been born with when he pertinaciously imagines that
all dark-coloured people have woolly heads and thick lips, and speak
the broken English of the negro; nor has he the slightest conception
of the relative position of great towns in India, or which States are
independent; or who the Nizam is, or if his contingent is not some part
of his dress; or whether the Taj is not the husband of the Begum mentioned
in Pendennis.&nbsp; He has a vague notion that nabobs come from India,
and has heard perhaps of cabobs, but what the difference is, or whether
they are not articles of Indian export usually packed in casks, he has
not the most remote conception.&nbsp; For all the light, therefore,
that John Bull could throw upon the subject of who or what Jung Bahadoor
was, besides being the Nepaulese ambassador, or where the country was
that he came to represent, it might remain a mystery to the present
day.</p>
<p>But even supposing the public were better informed on Indian affairs,
it would not be a matter of surprise that they should be under a misconception
as to what Jung&rsquo;s position in his own country might be, seeing
that it is not usual amongst European nations to send their prime ministers
on foreign missions.&nbsp; But to estimate correctly the minister&rsquo;s
power and authority, the word &ldquo;send&rdquo; perhaps ought not to
be used in this case, since he was a self-appointed ambassador; and
his next brother was left by him to perform the arduous duties attendant
on the important office which he vacated for a while.</p>
<p>And now that he is returned to resume the reins of government, and
once more become involved in the petty intrigues of his highland court,
it is natural that he should look back with delight, not unmingled with
regret, at the wonders he has so lately witnessed&mdash;the, to him,
magical effects of the operations of steam&mdash;the still more incomprehensible
electric telegraph&mdash;our institutions&mdash;our court&mdash;the
magnificence of the successive entertainments, of which he could say
&ldquo;Magna pars fui,&rdquo; and at which he was not more the spectator
than the spectacle: but, above all, was it a matter of astonishment
to him that such hospitality should have been shown to an unknown and
ignorant stranger by a nation whose enterprise is no less stirring than
her resources are vast, and in the midst of a social machinery to him
so incomprehensibly intricate in its details.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he would observe after his return to Katmandu,
&ldquo;should I attempt to tell these poor ignorant people what I have
seen?&nbsp; It would be as ridiculous in me to suppose they would believe
it as it is hopeless to attempt to make them understand it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And he feels that the information he has acquired has been too extensive
to allow him to sink to the level of those by whom he is surrounded.&nbsp;
But, while anxious to increase his popularity, with his attempts at
conciliation is combined a patronizing air, which he cannot conceal,
and which is calculated to render him unpopular, even could he bring
himself to return to the old system of embracing instead of shaking
hands; of taking off his shoes when entering the Durbar; of salaaming
ere he addresses his Monarch&mdash;all which acts of devotion and homage
are repugnant to the man who has had an interview with the Queen of
England, and received a visit from the Duke of Wellington.&nbsp; &ldquo;When
that great warrior called upon me,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I felt it
to be the proudest moment of my life:&rdquo; and at Benares, when, upon
the occasion of his visiting a native Rajah, there was a question of
whether he should go in state or not, he decided the matter by saying,
&ldquo;I shall go just as I went to return the Duke&rsquo;s visit;&rdquo;
or, at another time, &ldquo;I will receive the Rajah in a friendly way,
just as I did the Duke when he called upon me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nothing
seemed to impress him so deeply as the absence of all display where
genuine greatness rendered it unnecessary; and he looks with no slight
contempt upon the pomp to which he in common with his court was formerly
so much attached.&nbsp; That court, however, retaining of course its
old unenlightened sentiments, looks with suspicion and distrust on the
independent manners of the returned prime minister.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
has become a Feringhee.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He wants to introduce their
barbarous customs amongst us.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He brings visitors,
and is making friends with the English, in order to betray us to them.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This is said by his enemies at court; and, while they watch his every
action, esteem him a traitor, who, if they did but know it, is the best
friend of their country.&nbsp; Thus, in spite of his earnest desire
to promote its welfare, he is likely to be thwarted, and his ardent
and somewhat impatient temperament will not, it is to be feared, improve
matters, however good his intentions may he.&nbsp; That he is already
careful lest he offend any prejudices, I had a convincing and most annoying
proof.</p>
<p>On the journey through India, while in high spirits, out shooting,
he had promised to allow us to travel over any part of Nepaul we might
wish to visit&mdash;a permission never yet granted to any European.&nbsp;
To the fulfilment of this promise we naturally looked with no small
pleasure; but, after a residence of a week in Nepaul, the anti-Anglican
feeling was so strongly manifested, that the mere fact of four or five
European visitors having been in Katmandu (for Lord G--- and his party
were among his guests) brought upon him a certain degree of odium.</p>
<p>To allow strangers to visit Nepaul, and reside at Katmandu, was unusual,
but bearable; the idea of a common beef-eater infringing the limits
of a circle beyond which no British resident, much less traveller, had
ever penetrated, was so monstrous a heresy on the part of the prime
minister&mdash;so serious an infraction of a well-established rule&mdash;that
even Jung felt it to be too unpopular an act by which to celebrate his
return to his country.&nbsp; It was with much regret that we were obliged
to relinquish so interesting an enterprise.&nbsp; I must not, however,
forget his offer to adhere to his promise if we wished it, saying at
the same time that his doing so would seriously compromise him.&nbsp;
But, as <i>compromise</i> and <i>decapitate</i> may be looked upon as
synonymous terms in Nepaul, we felt that it was hardly fair to our kind
host to place him in such an awkward position; and as, moreover, the
effect of his being so compromised in Katmandu would have probably entailed
upon us a precisely similar fate, we considered it hardly fair to the
guests either.&nbsp; But while thus hanging back from his promise on
the score of compromising himself, I am fully persuaded that personal
considerations had but little to do in the matter.&nbsp; He is looking
out for means of usefulness, and it was more the fear of retarding his
schemes of improvement by thus increasing the popular discontent that
induced him to change his mind, than any hope of retaining his head
upon his shoulders.&nbsp; The difficulty of doing this can be but very
slightly increased; and it must be admitted that he esteems life as
lightly in his own case as he formerly did when others were concerned.</p>
<p>It cannot but be regretted that with so pure an object he should
be totally without co-operation from any quarter.&nbsp; The young King,
capable only of aiding in nefarious schemes, such as those already recounted,
can in no way comprehend the new-fangled philanthropic views of the
prime minister: He cares little about the welfare of his country; his
amusement seems to consist in concocting and executing bloody designs,
and his mind must be so accustomed to this species of excitement that
it can scarce do without it.&nbsp; It is unfortunate that the Rajah&rsquo;s
hobby should lie in this peculiar direction, more unfortunate still
that the contemplated victim should be Jung; for I presume that there
is little doubt that the King&rsquo;s brother, who was engaged in the
last conspiracy against the minister&rsquo;s life&mdash;which took place
a few days after my visit&mdash;must have acted with the knowledge,
and most probably at the instigation, of his Majesty.</p>
<p>Nor can Jung look to his brothers for support as in times of old:
one of them, whom he esteemed amongst the most faithful, was, as before
mentioned, deeply implicated in the same attempt on his life; and there
is no one now on whom he can confidently depend in the hour of need
except the two youngest of the family, who accompanied him to England,
and whom I consider thoroughly devoted to his interests.&nbsp; Deserted
by his King, who owes his throne to him, his life conspired against
by one of his own brothers, bound to him by the yet stronger ties of
blood, he stands alone a mark for the dagger of any one who would win
the approval of his degraded Sovereign.&nbsp; But his bearing is not
the less bold, or his eye less piercing, as he makes the man quail before
him who is that moment planning his destruction.&nbsp; He anticipates
the fate of his fourteen predecessors; they were all assassinated!&nbsp;
His predecessors, however, did not surround themselves with a guard
armed with rifles always loaded. <a name="citation121"></a><a href="#footnote121">{121}</a>&nbsp;
In all probability the man who takes the life of the prime minister
will do so at the price of his own.&nbsp; So securely guarded is he,
and so careful of his own safety, that I cannot but hope he may live
to frustrate the designs of his enemies, and to carry out that enlightened
policy which, while it morally elevates the people, would develop the
resources of a country possessing many natural advantages, in its delightful
climate, fertile soil, and industrious population.&nbsp; Valleys unvisited
by civilization save as received through the medium of a few semi-barbarous
travellers, may contain treasures which they are now unknown to possess;
mines of copper, lead, and antimony, now clumsily worked, may be made
to yield of their abundance; tracts of uncultivated lands be brought
into rich cultivation, and efficient means of transport would carry
their produce far and wide through the country.&nbsp; Katmandu itself
would be on the high road for the costly trade of Chinese Tartary and
Thibet with the provinces of Upper India.</p>
<p>In fact it is impossible to enumerate the various benefits which
would accrue to the country were a different system of government adopted;
and it is much to be feared that unless the present prime minister lives
to accomplish the task he has undertaken, no one of his successors,
for some time to come at least, will have either the will or the ability
requisite for its successful consummation.</p>
<p>In some of his legislative acts Jung had shown himself to be in advance
of his age before he left Nepaul.&nbsp; No less than twenty-two punishments
for various crimes, principally consisting of different modes of torture,
were abolished.&nbsp; A thief must have been three times convicted of
the crime ere he can suffer the penalty entailed upon the offence, viz.,
loss of his hand; and after it is cut off, he has his choice between
having it bound up or allowing himself to bleed to death.&nbsp; I understood
the latter alternative to be the one usually chosen by the culprit.&nbsp;
Gambling is strictly prohibited in Nepaul, except for four or five days
during the celebration of the Devali.</p>
<p>Women are not liable to capital punishment.&nbsp; The mutilation
of noses no longer exists, although some years ago it was the most usual
punishment, and one village was entirely peopled by the unfortunate
victims of such barbarous treatment.</p>
<p>The amount of labour which his position as prime minister entails
upon Jung is almost incredible; the simplest bargain cannot be struck,
nor a cooly engaged, nor can a departure or an arrival take place, without
his sign manual.&nbsp; In fact he comprises within himself the whole
of the ministry, besides doing the entire duty of the several departments,
and the office of premier in Nepaul can be no more a sinecure than it
is in England.&nbsp; One can only wonder that a position fraught with
such imminent danger to its possessor, and bringing upon him such incessant
trouble and responsibility, should be so eagerly sought, when it entails
the almost absolute certainty of a violent death.&nbsp; With us moral
courage is an indispensable quality for a prime minister; in Nepaul,
physical courage is no less needed.&nbsp; If he is a good shot, and
expert with his kukri and kora, so much the better for him.&nbsp; As
regards both these accomplishments Jung was eminently qualified for
the post he now holds; but his literary acquirements were of a very
low order, for upon becoming prime minister he could neither read nor
write.&nbsp; Finding great inconvenience from his incapacity in these
respects, he applied himself diligently to his alphabet, and was soon
able to carry on all official correspondence of any importance to himself.&nbsp;
The whole of the political, fiscal, and judicial communications are
submitted to him, and the departments controlled by him, very little
regard being had to the Rajah&rsquo;s will on the subject.</p>
<p>The next officer in rank to Jung Bahadoor is his brother, Bum Bahadoor,
who bears the mark on his hand of the horrible action in Durbar already
recorded.&nbsp; He appeared inferior in ability to his brother, but
it is difficult to judge of the talent of any one who is in a subordinate
position in Nepaul.</p>
<p>The Raj Guru is the highest spiritual dignitary in Nepaul, and in
that capacity received the greatest deference from every one, including
Jung, whose popularity in some measure rests on his intimate relations
with the chief priest, to whom he invariably paid every mark of respect.&nbsp;
The Raj Guru met us at Benares, and granted indulgences to those who
had visited England.&nbsp; So great is the respect shown him, that upon
entering his presence the prime minister invariably touched with his
forehead the foot of the holy man.&nbsp; To the office of spiritual
adviser to the Rajah is added that of judge of the spiritual court,
which is one of great emolument, arising chiefly from fines levied on
the infraction of religious ceremonies or ordinances&mdash;such as the
killing or maltreating of a cow and other like enormities.</p>
<p>Next in order follow the Kazies, or &ldquo;Patres conscripti,&rdquo;
who ought to possess some voice in the administration of affairs, but
are content to remain silent during the independent rule of the Minister
Sahib.&nbsp; They number thirty or forty, and their duty is to consult
upon all weighty matters connected with the Government, while some act
as governors of provinces, others as judges in important causes.</p>
<p>Then come the Sirdars, who also decide causes, and possess considerable
authority in the more remote districts, governing some of the provinces,
and superintending the collection of revenue.&nbsp; Their number is
far larger than that of the Kazies.</p>
<p>We visited the supreme court one day and saw the Chief-justice, or
Durma Dikar, sitting cross-legged (smoking his hookah on the verandah),
the court having adjourned.&nbsp; The old man bore that venerable appearance
which is everywhere esteemed inseparable from the judicial character,
and I doubted whether his long grey beard was not a more imposing, as
it certainly was a more natural and graceful, appendage than a wig.</p>
<p>There are six law courts in Katmandu, presided over by Sirdars and
Bicharees, and the laws and modes of punishment are very effectual for
the prevention of crime; for although a prisoner cannot be convicted
except upon his own confession, he may be subjected to an ordeal which
will most probably extort it; and, perhaps, in an eastern country justice
is more effectually administered by such methods than where the judge
decides on the guilt or innocence of a man by speculating on the character
of the witnesses, and believing those who look most as if they were
telling the truth; and where, although he knows that all the witnesses
are more or less bribed, he is not allowed to take any but a voluntary
admission from the prisoner, when perhaps a little gentle persuasion
would save a great deal of unnecessary trouble, to say nothing of the
amount of lying that might thus be dispensed with.&nbsp; Whatever the
laws may be, they seem to give perfect satisfaction to the inhabitants,
who cannot be called a litigious race.</p>
<p>While we were at Bisoleah, on our way to Katmandu, an interesting
instance occurred of the prime minister taking the law into his own
hands; and, as far as we could judge, complete justice was done to the
parties.&nbsp; A complaint was preferred by a deputation of the peasantry
of the Terai against one of the sirdars who was a member of his suite,
and who had been governor of some part of the district before he had
accompanied the minister on his expedition to England.&nbsp; It was
alleged that he had, in connection with his brother, who was an especial
favourite with Jung, defrauded them of 25,000 rupees.&nbsp; This charge
was indignantly denied by the two sirdars.&nbsp; The case was fully
entered into, and the result was, that Jung became convinced of the
justice of the claim of the peasantry.&nbsp; He had no sooner satisfied
himself on this point than he ordered both the noblemen to be placed
in confinement, where they were to remain until the required sum was
forthcoming.&nbsp; The affair delayed us twenty-four hours; and I perfectly
well remember wondering at the time what could be the cause of a detention
for so long a period in so unpleasant a locality; more especially as
by it we lost the chance of a day&rsquo;s rhinoceros shooting, which
was, doubtless, as great a disappointment to Jung as to myself.</p>
<p>By thus carefully protecting the interests of the peasantry he has
endeared himself to them, since they are always sure of a ready and
attentive hearing of any complaint, although it may affect the highest
nobles in the land.&nbsp; In talking to a man who acted as guide on
our return through the Terai, we discovered that the popularity of Jung,
arising from this cause, had extended across the frontier, and had induced
my informant to migrate into the Nepaul dominions, so that he might
benefit by the paternal rule of its prime minister.&nbsp; He said the
taxes were lighter, and he led altogether a more happy and independent
life than in the Company&rsquo;s dominions, where the native officers
employed as tax-gatherers do not always display the most scrupulous
honesty.</p>
<p>But it is not with the peasantry alone that Jung is so deservedly
a favourite.&nbsp; With the soldiers he is, if possible, still more
popular.&nbsp; An admirer of Napoleon, he has profited by the perusal
of his life, and turns to advantage his knowledge of the influence possessed
in so wonderful a manner by one whom he seeks in every respect to imitate,
so far as the difference of position admits.&nbsp; That he has succeeded
admirably with the army there is no doubt.&nbsp; His personal feats
of daring and known courage are considerable aids to an imitation of
the more scientific means employed by his great model.</p>
<p>Thus, firmly seated in the affections of the most important portions
of the community over which he rules with unlimited power, and a most
ardent wish to improve their condition, it will be on all accounts most
deplorable if the country is deprived of the services of so valuable
a man by some vile plot, emanating from the petty intrigue of a jealous
and disappointed Durbar.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<p><i>The temple of Balajee&mdash;The old Newar capital&mdash;The houses
and temples of Patn&mdash;View from the city gates&mdash;Nepaulese festivals&mdash;The
Newars skilful artisans&mdash;The arsenal&mdash;The magazine and cannon-foundry</i>.</p>
<p>One afternoon we strolled across some verdant meadows, and along
narrow shady avenues, to visit the temple of Balajee.&nbsp; There is
nothing in the building itself worthy of notice; but near it is a tank
of beautifully clear water, filled with sacred fishes, which crowd near
the visitor as he stands on the brink, expecting to be fed with grain,
which some old women at the gate sell for their especial benefit.&nbsp;
Balajee is one of those sheltered nooks which make the scenery of Nepaul
so attractive.&nbsp; Immediately under a wooded knoll the trees dip
into the tank, from whence the water leaps in three tiny cascades into
the court-yard of the temple, quaint and singular itself, and rendered
still more interesting from its connexion with the sacred fonts and
groves near which it is so romantically situated.</p>
<p>Hitherto we had seen no Newar town.&nbsp; Katmandu, the capital of
Nepaul, was built by the conquering Ghorkas, and is comparatively modern.&nbsp;
The old Newar capital is Patn: situated on a green slope, and fortified
by a high wall, it looks picturesque when seen from the modern city,
from which it is distant about two miles.</p>
<p>Crossing the narrow brick bridge which spans the Bhagmutty, outside
the walls of the town, we shortly after entered the massive old gates
of the ancient capital.&nbsp; As we trotted past the high rickety houses,
along the brick pavement of the narrow streets, still slippery from
the morning dew, we encountered troops of girls with garlands in their
hair, for this was some festive day.&nbsp; At the corners of the streets
were beings of both sexes, as decrepit as the houses under which they
crouched, presiding over baskets full of beautiful flowers.&nbsp; The
entire population were Newars, except a few fierce mustachioed Ghorkas,
who stood sentinels over the temples, or loitered about the guard-house.&nbsp;
The long street looked deserted; there was not a single shop in it;
and the foot-passengers were few and far between.&nbsp; But the grand
square was the chief feature of the place, and was well worthy of a
visit.&nbsp; We looked with astonishment and delight at the incongruous
mass of buildings, of the most varied and fantastic construction, yet
massive and substantial; but whence the designs originated, or in what
other part of the known world anything is to be seen approaching to
the style of Newar architecture, it would be impossible to conjecture.&nbsp;
Houses built of horn are said to exist at Lassa; and from Lassa, I should
imagine, came the designs for the temples and houses of Patn.&nbsp;
Time has mellowed their bright colours&mdash;if they were ever painted
at all like those at Katmandu&mdash;into a sombre, quiet grey.&nbsp;
The Durbar, a huge, massive building, is absolutely covered with black
wood-carving.&nbsp; The care displayed in its execution is still apparent
through the mass of dust and cobwebs which almost conceal it; for the
old Durbar of Patn is deserted.&nbsp; The residence of the monarchs
who ruled the happy valley is in strong contrast with the smiling appearance
of their former territory.&nbsp; It alone seems to have gone into mourning
for its former occupants, while the valley seems to thrive as well under
the rule of the Ghorkas as it did under that of the Newars.&nbsp; The
Durbar is of great extent, and occupies one side of the square, in the
centre of which stand two monoliths, between 30 and 40 feet high: on
one of them is the figure of an angel, represented in all respects as
angels usually are, with the addition of a magnificent gilt tail; this,
together with a pair of large gilt wings, gave it a most gorgeous appearance.&nbsp;
My Ghorka guide could give me no information as to what particular divinity
this figure was intended to represent.&nbsp; The other pillar was crowned
by the figure of a Newar monarch with an unpronounceable name, who was
watched over by a cobra, standing upon its tail, and looking over his
head with its mouth wide open.</p>
<p>On the opposite side to that on which the Durbar was situated were
two temples: one of them, built of grey sandstone, was an imposing structure,
altogether different from any building, lay or ecclesiastical, that
I had ever seen before.&nbsp; The lower story consisted of massive verandahs
or cloisters; the pillars were all of grey sandstone, very simple in
form; and the connecting arch was somewhat Saracenic in its appearance.&nbsp;
The temple was square, and the corridor which ran round it was elevated
considerably above the level of the court: the ascent to it was by two
flights of steps, each guarded by a pair of sculptured winged lions.&nbsp;
Three stories of light belfry-like temples, three upon each side of
the square, surmounted each other in rows; in the centre was a mass
of architecture between a dome and a spire, rising to a height of upwards
of 100 feet above the level of the court: the whole formed a pyramidal
structure ornamented with fantastic devices, and undoubtedly Bhuddist
in its character.</p>
<p>The other temple was a two-storied pagoda; its bright colours were
faded, and it appeared far inferior to those of more recent construction.&nbsp;
There were also ruined pyramidal shrines of no known architecture, and
difficult to describe from their complicated nature&mdash;antique specimens
of the masonry of ages long gone by, and memorials of a religion doubtless
impure, although Bhuddist in its character and origin.</p>
<p>No less singular were the residences of the old Newar nobility, a
race which no longer exists, and the only remains of which now extant
are their ruined habitations, evidently destined to succumb before long
to the same all-destroying power which has long since obliterated every
trace of their former owners.</p>
<p>How different was the peculiar yet handsome style which distinguished
the dwellings of the Newar nobles at Patn from the tawdry glitter which
characterises the mansions of the present Ghorka chiefs in the modern
capital!&nbsp; Here the carving is more rich, the ornaments more massive,
the houses themselves are more lofty and capacious.&nbsp; Sometimes
two or three elaborately-carved balconies adorn the sombre but not less
imposing exterior; from the projecting eaves wooden tassels, forming
a sort of fringe, swing to and fro over the windows.</p>
<p>The roofs are beautifully tiled, each tile having a double curvature,
while the corners of the buildings are quaintly turned up, giving a
Chinese look to the building.&nbsp; The whole appearance of the houses
and temples carries one far from the mud-huts or close cities of the
plains of India, into the land of chopsticks and small feet, and the
traveller feels much nearer to Pekin than to Calcutta as he wanders
along the empty streets under the frowning houses and indescribable
temples of the Newar town of Patn.</p>
<p>Everything seemed to have been blighted by time; besides all the
old temples, old houses, old gates, and old streets, there were numbers
of old people.&nbsp; Everything seemed to sympathise with everything
else, and had evidently come to the conclusion that there was nothing
worth living for, and the sooner they all took themselves off and quitted
the bright valley of Nepaul the better.&nbsp; And indeed it was difficult
to realize the existence of anything half so cheerful inside the town
as the prospect which met our view as we emerged from its gloomy entrance,
and looked upon the luxuriant plain, the glittering capital shining
in its midst, whose gaudy pagodas, hung round with bells and adorned
with flags, were very different from those just visited; the industrious
population were going light-hearted to their work as we rode through
smiling fields, and we ceased to wonder at Patn looking deserted, for
it was evident that all the cheerfully disposed inhabitants had flitted
away, unable to bear its depressing influence, and leaving behind them
only the crabbed old people at the corners of the streets, and the tattered
beggars, who must make a meagre livelihood out of the falling temples
and 24,000 rotten houses of the once handsome capital of Nepaul.</p>
<p>It was a clear frosty morning, and, as we rode down the gentle slope
on which the old city stands, the snowy range of the Himalaya burst
upon us with inexpressible grandeur.&nbsp; The Gosain-than, a mass of
glistening snow, looked contemptuously down upon the Jibjibia, itself
covered with snow: though 13,000 feet lower than the Gosain-than, the
Jibjibia in turn overtopped the Sheopoorie, which rises abruptly from
the valley to a height of 2000 feet.&nbsp; On a peninsula, formed by
the junction of the Bhagmutty and Bishmutty, stands the town of Katmandu,
surrounded by a high wall in which are four gates: to the east the snow-capped
peaks extend as far as the eye can reach; to the west the Dawalogiri,
the highest mountain in the world, is in clear weather distinctly visible;
in that direction the valley is shut in by lofty hills, the steepest
of which is crossed by the Chandanagiri pass.</p>
<p>The exhilarating effect of so glorious a scene seemed not to be lost
upon the inhabitants themselves, and we observed among them the same
merry and contented appearance as that which is so remarkable amongst
the inhabitants of Switzerland and the Tyrol; indeed mountaineers in
general either have much fewer troubles than lowlanders, or take them
less to heart.</p>
<p>The Nepaulese, in common with most highland tribes, have strong religious
feelings, and are bigoted adherents to a faith which they would find
it somewhat difficult to define.&nbsp; One use to which they put their
religion, and in which they far exceed even the Roman Catholics of the
Alps, is, in making it furnish them with an almost unlimited number
of holidays and festivals: no opportunity of merrymaking is lost by
the light-hearted inhabitants of Nepaul, and in this respect they are
at once distinguishable from their more gloomy and saturnine conquerors,
the Ghorkas, who, glorying only in the art of war, look with contempt
on what they consider the frivolity of the Newars.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt of the warlike character of the Ghorkas, even
had not our own experience testified to the fact in a most unpleasant
way.&nbsp; Not only are they brave and skilful soldiers, but, for a
barbarous nation, they are wonderfully advanced in the art of fabricating
the implements of war; they cast their own ordnance, manufacture their
own muskets, shot, powder, and cartridge-boxes; in fact, every instrument
or weapon used in civilized warfare is manufactured in Nepaul, often
clumsily enough, but the mere fact of their being capable of being used,
and used with effect, is highly creditable to the ingenuity of the Ghorkas.</p>
<p>The Newars are still more skilful artisans than the Ghorkas, but
their talent does not lie in the same direction.&nbsp; The bricks of
Nepaul are deservedly famed; whether the virtue lies in the clay of
which they are formed, or the skill with which they are made, I do not
know&mdash;most probably in both.&nbsp; The Newars excel also in bell-making;
it is the trade of the land; they are all bell-makers from their youth,
and proofs of their skill are exhibited hanging at the corners of pagodas,
swinging from the roofs of houses, surmounting Dagobas&mdash;in fact,
the device upon a Nepaulese banner should be a bell.&nbsp; In jewellery
they are no less expert, and are elaborate workmen in all metals.&nbsp;
A species of coarse paper is manufactured by them from the bark of a
tree, which is first reduced to a pulp and then spread over a sheet
and dried.</p>
<p>They are as excellent agriculturists as tradesmen, and the rich soil
of the valley is not allowed by the industrious peasants to lie fallow
a moment longer than is necessary.</p>
<p>At certain seasons every inhabitant capable of wielding the hoe is
at work, and there is much incentive to such industry, for the soil
is inexhaustible, and seems as if it could go on for an indefinite period
yielding its four crops a year&mdash;namely, wheat, rice, Indian corn,
and vegetables&mdash;supporting thereby a double population.&nbsp; The
plough is never used.&nbsp; It struck me that the introduction of buffaloes
from the plains would be advantageous in assisting the worthy Newar,
whose religious scruples prevent his using the bullock.&nbsp; There
is a species of small buffalo, which is a native of the Himalayas, but
it is never brought down by the Bhootyas into the plains, nor even to
Katmandu.</p>
<p>We went one day to visit the arsenal, which a veteran of the Nepaul
army took an especial delight in exhibiting, and naturally looked for
expressions of wonder and delight from the barbarians.&nbsp; But the
only astonishment we felt was, that such a mass of fire-arms, so excessively
old and so excessively dirty, should be thought worthy of being carefully
ranged throughout the long dark rooms.&nbsp; In a corner of one of these
rooms the light streamed brightly through a window on some old-fashioned
firelocks bearing an English maker&rsquo;s name; they were trophies
of the war with the British, and were held worthy of conspicuous places
in the Nepaul arsenal.&nbsp; The delighted old Colonel pointed these
out to us with a laudable pride; he said the arsenal contained 100,000
stand of arms, and expected us to believe it.&nbsp; Had they been in
proper order, the collection would have been of importance numerically
considered.</p>
<p>Their artillery was insignificant, but they possessed trophies denied
to many more powerful nations in a pair of brass 2-pounders, also taken
from the British in the same disastrous campaign.&nbsp; I looked as
abashed and mortified as I could, and pleased the Colonel exceedingly
thereby.&nbsp; In the same establishment was carried on the process
of manufacturing powder of a very coarse grain, and we were shown sundry
store-rooms containing grape and canister.</p>
<p>Leaving the arsenal, we mounted our elephants, crossed the parade-ground
and the river, and, passing through the massive gateway, reached the
magazine, situated in the interior of the city, where we had an opportunity
of witnessing the process of hammering iron into balls.&nbsp; The Nepaulese
can produce no heat sufficient to cast balls, and are, consequently,
obliged to beat them into the required shape, an almost endless operation.&nbsp;
By this tedious process the making of each two-pound ball occupies two
men a whole day, and costs, including other incidental charges, about
a rupee, so that the expenses of a siege would come rather heavy upon
the Government.&nbsp; All round the court-yard blacksmiths were forging
and hammering, while in the middle of it a number of men were employed
beating leather, so as to render it sufficiently pliable to undergo
the process of being trodden soft, a curious operation, and fatiguing
to the muscles of any other legs than those of the Nepaulese, who keep
continually doubling up the leather and treading it out again, and putting
their feet to all sorts of uses, in which, if we had properly cultivated
the gifts of nature, we should, doubtless, be equally skilled.&nbsp;
At present our great object is to make our feet look smaller than they
naturally are, and even in that the Chinese excel us, civilized though
we be.&nbsp; The result of so much beating and treading was a number
of leather cartridge-boxes, which could not have been harder had they
been deal; so the means did not justify the end, and perhaps after all
we make better use of our feet than the Nepaulese tanners do.</p>
<p>In another part of the establishment was a gang of men engaged in
twisting gun-barrels, turning out wonderful productions, considering
the rude method employed.</p>
<p>The stocks were more easily fabricated, and the whole musket justified
the pride with which it was exhibited; but Jung is no longer satisfied
with the productions of the Nepaulese gunmakers.&nbsp; He visited a
gun-manufactory at Birmingham, and was most disagreeably surprised by
finding how different was the English mode of manufacturing the implements
of war from that employed in Nepaul.</p>
<p>In England Jung had seen brass guns cast by the score during his
short visit to the foundry.&nbsp; Here they were being cast at the rate
of one every two or three months.&nbsp; The metal is not allowed to
run into the mould in a continuous stream, but is ladled in, thereby
rendering the gun liable to flaws.&nbsp; There were many other improvements
which it would have been obvious to a practised eye were needed in the
gun-factory of Nepaul; and it was plain enough that everything was rough
and clumsy; but Jung had paid especial attention to these subjects while
in England, and intends speedily to introduce an improved system.&nbsp;
How long it will be ere he will have a steam-foundry established in
Katmandu time alone can show.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<p><i>Kindness of the Mahila Sahib&mdash;His motive&mdash;Drawing-room
ornaments&mdash;Visit to the palace of Jung Bahadoor&mdash;A trophy
of the London season&mdash;Grand Durbar at the reading of the Queen
of England&rsquo;s letter&mdash;Dress of the officers&mdash;Review of
troops&mdash;Dancing boys</i>.</p>
<p>The Mahila Sahib, the younger brother of his Majesty, was a very
pleasant-looking young man, with a much more amiable expression of countenance
than his royal brother, and professed to be one of Jung&rsquo;s greatest
friends and allies.&nbsp; As a compliment to the minister, he politely
requested us to pay him a visit, an invitation of which we were glad
to avail ourselves, since it proved his kindly feeling towards our host,
whilst it gave us an opportunity of inspecting the m&eacute;nage of
a Nepaulese Prince Royal.</p>
<p>It is worth while to make a trip to Nepaul, not only for the delight
of viewing the romantic beauty of its scenery, of wondering at the stupendous
height of its mountains, of roaming amidst its ancient cities, ruined
palaces, and glittering pagodas, but in order to take a lesson in human
nature, for we are not at liberty to suppose that the princes and nobles
of this country are a more depraved class than any other body of men,
the fact being that a Nepaulese follows his natural impulses, unfettered
by the restraints of our standard of civilization and morality, and
the results are apparent.&nbsp; Is not the more civilized inhabitant
of western lands actuated by the same feelings, and would he not behave
in the same manner as his swarthy brother in the East, had he been brought
up in the same code of morality, and were he as fearless of the consequences
of his following the bent of his own inclination?&nbsp; But if so, then
the visitor to Nepaul simply sees the game of human life played openly
and unconstrainedly, and in no way hampered by the rules which prevail
in more civilized countries; and the unsophisticated tyro has only to
come here and learn in a month what would cost him a lifetime of anxious
study in a country enjoying the blessings of civilization.</p>
<p>The palace of the Mahila Sahib is situated in a court-yard, and is
entered by a small doorway, by no means in keeping with the handsome
staircase, lined with muskets, up which we followed the prince, who
had come to the entrance to meet us.&nbsp; We were ushered into a long
narrow room, similar in shape to the reception-room in all other Nepaulese
palaces, and adorned in like manner with a profusion of pictures, occidental
as well as oriental, while in the midst, upon a round table, and displayed
as drawing-room ornaments, was an incongruous collection of articles,
amongst which I remarked three leaden spoons, an old cruet-stand, a
Bohemian glass scent-bottle, an old hair-brush and tooth-brush on some
hot-water plates, a pair of brass candlesticks, and other wares usually
found in kitchens, pantries, and bedrooms.&nbsp; Some English prints
and pictures of a particularly pothouse appearance attracted me into
a little side room, where a handsome telescope stood pointed out of
the open window, from which there was a lovely and extensive view, and
while my friend and the prince were chatting in the next room I took
advantage of the means thus afforded me of enjoying the prospect.</p>
<p>On looking through the telescope the first object which met my eye
was the roof of a handsome house, on which figures were moving briskly
to and fro.&nbsp; All the windows of this mansion were commanded by
the glass, and I almost imagined I could see the female figures flitting
about in the more gloomy and secluded part, which seemed to be the harem.&nbsp;
The house thus under observation struck me as being known to me, and
upon looking at the neighbouring objects I perceived that it was the
palace of the Minister Sahib.</p>
<p>The fact of the glass being thus pointed to his house was in itself
a suspicious circumstance, but I little thought that the bland owner
of the leaden spoons and pothouse pictures was then deliberately contemplating
the vile plot he so soon afterwards nearly succeeded in executing.&nbsp;
Within a week after this visit I heard that our polite entertainer was
in confinement for an attempt to assassinate the minister, towards whom
he had so recently professed the profoundest sentiments of regard.</p>
<p>We descended into the well laid-out garden attached to the palace
and devoured the delicious mandarin oranges, with which hundreds of
trees were loaded, until our attention was diverted from them by a luscious
fruit, in appearance something like a medlar: this fruit is rare in
Nepaul, the tree being a native of Thibet.</p>
<p>It cost us an effort to bid adieu to the polite prince and his attractive
garden; but at length we remounted our elephants and proceeded on our
way to the Minister&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; Passing through the handsome
gateway, guarded by a magnificent tiger, that prowled restlessly up
and down his cage, a vigilant-looking sentinel, we entered a yard filled
with the soldiers and retainers of the illustrious man whom we had come
to visit.</p>
<p>We were greeted cordially by the Minister Sahib, who was surrounded
by a crowd of brothers, only three of whom I knew, viz. the two fat
travellers and the future would-be assassin.</p>
<p>Jung&rsquo;s house was a large white building, which looked as if
a Chinaman had mixed together a Birmingham factory and an Italian villa,
every now and then throwing in a strong dash of the style of his own
country by way of improvement.&nbsp; It is three stories high, and one
wing is devoted to the six &ldquo;beautiful missises&rdquo; who compose
the female part of his establishment.</p>
<p>The state-room was very similar in shape and appearance to that in
the palace of the Mahila Sahib, but was, if possible, still more fantastically
ornamented.&nbsp; A picture of her Majesty&rsquo;s Coronation was supported
on the one side by a lady&rsquo;s bonnet, on the other by a carpet-bag,
while a lady&rsquo;s riding-habit, an officer&rsquo;s red jacket, and
various other articles of attire were hung round the walls upon pegs;
here and there, perhaps partly hidden by the folds of a lady&rsquo;s
dress, was to be seen the portrait of some sedate old Nepaulese noble.</p>
<p>Jung called our attention to one of these; it was the portrait of
a strikingly handsome man, whose keen eye and lofty brow seemed almost
to entitle him to the position he held between the Duke of Wellington
and the Queen.&nbsp; &ldquo;See,&rdquo; said Jung, enthusiastically,
&ldquo;here is the Queen of England; and she has not got a more loyal
subject than I am.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then turning to the picture of the man
with the keen eyes and high forehead, he remarked, &ldquo;That is my
poor uncle Mahtiber Singh, whom I shot; it is very like him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
After which he launched into a discussion upon the comparative merits
of the Duke of Wellington and Napoleon, and, skipping two cocked hats
and a bonnet, went on to some Purdy&rsquo;s rifles, of which he spoke
in glowing terms and with all the enthusiasm of a true sportsman.</p>
<p>My friend Colonel Dhere Shum Shere now came up, whistling the Sturm
Marsch, and challenged me to a game of billiards: he was in his manner
more thoroughly English than any native I ever knew, and both in appearance
and disposition looked as if he was an Anglo-Saxon who had been dyed
by mistake.&nbsp; When in Europe he used to dress like an Englishman,
and in company with his brother, the Minister Sahib, in similar attire,
patronized Vauxhall, Cremorne, and other places of fashionable resort
usually frequented by such fast men as they showed themselves to be.&nbsp;
Like Jung, he used to say he could not bear the abominable screeching
at the Opera, and consequently never made his appearance until the commencement
of the ballet, which was much more in their line.</p>
<p>Having profited by his visits to European houses, Jung intends to
show his enlightenment by substituting pictures for the articles of
vertu with which the walls of his room are at present adorned, and to
exchange kitchen ware for albums, in order to prove that he has travelled
to some purpose.&nbsp; While examining these table ornaments, I observed
a civilized looking little square piece of satin, and on taking it up
found I was inspecting the first invitation to Her Majesty&rsquo;s Opera
that had ever reached Nepaul.</p>
<p>In one apartment 700 pounds worth of ladies&rsquo; dresses, purchased
in England, were spread upon the floor, destined, I presume, to adorn
some sable beauties on whom the fashionable flounces of Madame Devy
would be anything but becoming.</p>
<p>Jung informed us that a grand ceremony was to take place on the following
day.&nbsp; The Queen of England&rsquo;s letter, of which he was the
bearer, was to be read in full Durbar under a salute of twenty-one guns&mdash;a
greater honour than is shown even to a communication from his Imperial
Majesty of the celestial empire.</p>
<p>We accordingly repaired at the appointed hour next morning to the
palace of the King, in the great square of Katmandu, and were ushered
into the narrow room appropriated to the Durbar.&nbsp; It was hung round
with pictures that a tavern would be ashamed of, and altogether looked
so dirty that, had it been a tavern, it would have had but little custom.</p>
<p>Seated on a throne were the two Kings gorgeously apparelled and bedizened
with jewels, while the Minister Sahib wore nothing but the simple bukkoo,
or fur-robe, of great value but unassuming appearance.</p>
<p>There was to be a review of the troops after Durbar, and, as nearly
all the nobility of Nepaul hold rank in the army, the whole assemblage
was in uniform, certainly one of the most dazzling that I ever saw collected
together.&nbsp; Each man had twice as many feathers as he was entitled
to wear, and, while their cocked hats were always completely hid, the
bodies of the more diminutive officers almost shared the same fate.&nbsp;
The English dragoon and the French hussar might here recognize portions
of their uniform, adorned with gold and silver lace to an extent which
field-marshals alone have, with us, a right to indulge in, and often
mixed up with some Oriental finery&mdash;a pair of glittering slippers
that consorted but ill with the tightly strapped-down gold lace trowsers,
or a handsome shawl that clumsily supported the jewelled sabre.</p>
<p>The ceremony of presentation having been gone through, a select party,
consisting of the two Kings, the English Resident and one or two officers
of the Embassy, and the Prime Minister, adjourned to an upper room.&nbsp;
This seemed to me a curious proceeding, and one which the remaining
portion of the legislators must have thought particularly unsatisfactory:
however they looked as if they did not care, or could not help it; and
while the coterie above were solemnly perusing Her Majesty&rsquo;s epistle,
and the guns were booming in honour of it, we below were chatting upon
indifferent matters, until the Royal party returned, when, in addition
to the pawn usually given on such occasions, we were presented by their
Majesties with some Nepaulese weapons, and amidst more firing of cannon
left the palace in the Minister&rsquo;s pha&euml;ton to witness a grand
review.</p>
<p>The parade-ground was situated immediately under the city walls,
and upon it 6000 men were drawn up: the uniforms differed in some instances;
the &ldquo;rifles&rdquo; were in a pea-green suit which hung about them
loosely, while the regiments of the line wore red coats, with trowsers
ample enough to please a Turk.&nbsp; Upon their turbans or caps were
the distinguishing badges of their respective corps&mdash;a half-moon,
a lion, the sun, and various other devices.&nbsp; The regiments were
not numbered as with us, but adopted some magniloquent high-sounding
title suggestive of their valour in war, fearlessness of danger, and
other martial qualities.</p>
<p>There was no cavalry, the country not being adapted to that arm of
the service, but the artillery seemed very fairly handled; there was
an immense deal of firing, both of small arms and great guns, which
I believe was very good; and there were a great number of evolutions
performed, which, as I am not a soldier, did not seem to me more incomprehensible
than such manoeuvring usually is, but I was informed by those who were
capable of judging that in this instance they really were altogether
without meaning.&nbsp; Regiment after regiment marched past, the men
swinging their arms regularly as they moved, and trying to persuade
themselves they were British grenadiers.&nbsp; At all events the band
was playing that tune.&nbsp; Suddenly the music changed; they struck
up a lively polka, and a number of little boys in a sort of penwiper
costume, clasping one another like civilized ladies and gentlemen, began
to caper about, after which they went through various antics that surpassed
even the wildest notions of our highly civilized community: all this
while the troops were man&oelig;uvring as vehemently as ever, and the
boys were dancing as fantastically; and the whole thing was so eminently
ridiculous and looked so very like a farce, that it was difficult to
maintain that dignified and sedate appearance which was expected from
the spectators of a scene so imposing.</p>
<p>Jung alone looked for no expressions of surprise or admiration from
us, but was evidently disappointed and chagrined at the inferiority
of his own soldiers to those he had seen in Europe and amongst our Indian
troops.&nbsp; He could indeed point with pride to the stalwart bearing
and soldier-like appearance of his men, but he had seen &ldquo;the Guards&rdquo;
reviewed, he had been present at an inspection of 15,000 of the French
army at Versailles, and he seemed half ashamed of the display we were
witnessing, notwithstanding our efforts to comfort him by telling him
that we had little thought the art of war was so far advanced in the
wild valleys and rocky mountains of Nepaul.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<p><i>Distinguishing features of the races of Nepaul&mdash;The Ghorkas&mdash;Conquest
by them of Katmandu&mdash;Maintenance of the Nepaul army&mdash;Bheem
Singh&rsquo;s monument&mdash;A feast at the minister&rsquo;s&mdash;We
bid him adieu&mdash;Ascent of the Sheopoori&mdash;Magnificent view of
the Himalayas from its summit</i>.</p>
<p>The grand review over, we availed ourselves of the opportunity to
inspect the regiments composed of men recruited in some of the most
distant provinces of Nepaul.&nbsp; They bore in their countenances little
resemblance either to the Ghorkas or Newars.&nbsp; We examined their
faces, and tried to imagine what sort of a looking country was likely
to produce this sort of a looking man.&nbsp; A regiment of dark-visaged
stalwart Ghorkas would march past, followed by a diminutive race from
the north-western frontier, little, ill-made, and abominably ugly.&nbsp;
The same cast of countenance was prevalent throughout the regiments
that had been recruited there; all the men had the same high cheek-bones,
or wide mouths, or whatever their peculiarity might be.&nbsp; The insignificant
Newars looked majestic by the side of these men, while in their turn
their own strong Chinese characteristics were thrown completely into
the shade by some regiment from the north-east, almost pure Bootyan
or Mongolian.</p>
<p>There are not, however, many Newars employed as soldiers, and the
army is chiefly composed of Muggurs, Gurungs, and Krats.&nbsp; These
tribes differ only in their religion, according as it combines in a
greater or less degree the superstitions of the Hindoo worship with
those of Bhuddism.&nbsp; But none of these races differed from one another
more completely than did the Ghorka from them all; he was the only man
among them born to be a soldier, and he looked with contempt upon the
mongrel races that surrounded him.</p>
<p>The country from which he himself originally sprang is nevertheless
a matter of speculation; he certainly is not of trans-Himalayan origin,
but no doubt the comfortable life he leads in Nepaul prevents his caring
to inquire whence he came.&nbsp; The Rajah claims descent from the Rajput
princes.&nbsp; The capital town of the country from which they descended
into the valley of Nepaul is Ghorka, situated about fifty miles westward
of Katmandu.&nbsp; The Ghorkas had already possessed themselves of the
whole territory to the westward for some hundred of miles until their
border touched the kingdom of Runjeit Singh and the vale of Cashmere;
they then turned their conquering arms eastward in 1716, and, overrunning
the valleys of the Newars, their progress was only arrested on the Sikkim
frontier.</p>
<p>The conquest of the valley of Katmandu was attended with circumstances
of the greatest barbarity; thousands of the inhabitants were starved
to death by the Ghorka King, Prithi Naraim.&nbsp; There were then in
Nepaul a few Christians, converted by a Jesuit mission.&nbsp; These
were all compelled to fly the country, some taking refuge in Thibet,
others crossing our frontier and settling at Bettiah, where a Christian
community at present exists.&nbsp; Not long after he had conquered Nepaul,
the Ghorka monarch organized an expedition into Tartary, which was so
signally successful that the H&rsquo;Lassa Government was obliged to
treat on humiliating conditions.&nbsp; This advantage was followed,
in defiance of the treaty, by another invasion, which was only arrested
by the forces of the Emperor, who, having heard of the violent proceedings
in this distant part of his dominions, sent an army of 70,000 men to
oppose the Ghorka invaders, who were completely overwhelmed and obliged
to retreat.&nbsp; The Chinese followed the retiring force across their
own frontier, and not until they had reached the valley of Noyakot,
eighteen miles from Katmandu, did they consent to treat for peace, which
was now humbly sued for by the Ghorka King.</p>
<p>Not satisfied with serving as soldiers in their own country, the
Ghorkas have offered their services to the Indian Government, and two
of its finest regiments are composed of soldiers of this race.</p>
<p>No European, as far as I could learn, has ever yet penetrated to
their city, which however can contain no object of very great attraction,
since it must want those Chinese peculiarities which render Katmandu
and Patn so interesting, and must more nearly resemble the large cities
of the plains.&nbsp; It has a large population, is well built and fortified,
and is situated on a commanding eminence.</p>
<p>The Nepaul army is maintained partly by the state, the men being
in some instances paid out of the treasury, but more frequently by an
assignment of land to each man called a jaghire.&nbsp; They are thus
remunerated at the expense of the Newars, who are the cultivators of
the soil and were the original proprietors.&nbsp; Hence Nepaul is a
warlike state, not merely from the natural disposition of its Ghorka
conquerors, but from the inducements held out to them to become soldiers.</p>
<p>What would our grumbling agricultural population say to having soldiers
billeted in each village, and living on the fat of the land?&nbsp; The
Newars say, &ldquo;Take away the army and give us free trade;&rdquo;
the farmers in England say, &ldquo;Keep up the army and take away free
trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister told us of out-stations at which different regiments
were posted, and wanted us to believe that the standing army of Nepaul
exceeded 25,000 men.&nbsp; Every male is obliged to serve in the army
for a year, and it requires great interest to be allowed to remain above
that period, so eagerly is the profession of arms sought after.</p>
<p>Immediately facing the parade-ground stands the famous monument built
by Bheem Singh, one of the most eminent prime ministers that Nepaul
has ever seen, and who has left behind him proofs of his greatness in
the many works, both useful and ornamental, which he erected.</p>
<p>Two winged lions guard the chief bridge over the Bhagmutty, by which
Katmandu is approached, and pronounce Bheem Singh its builder.&nbsp;
Numerous temples and handsome palaces are adorned in like manner, but
the monument above mentioned is the most remarkable memorial of his
greatness, and is the chief ornament of the city.&nbsp; The people are
deservedly proud of this its distinguishing mark, for, except as minarets,
single columns are unknown in India, and in this respect their mountain
capital can boldly challenge a comparison with the proudest city of
the plains.&nbsp; The monument resembles in shape a portable telescope
fully drawn out, and rears its head to a height of nearly 200 feet above
the surrounding houses.&nbsp; The Minister Sahib contended that it was
higher than the monument of London.&nbsp; This, as in duty bound, I
patriotically denied; but which of us was led into error by partiality
for our respective countries I am not prepared to say.&nbsp; The Mahila
Sahib accompanied us to the summit, whence we had a most magnificent
view.&nbsp; Looking down into the city beneath us, we could discern
the turning of every narrow street, the palaces situated in the midst
of gardens, the hovels in the midst of dunghills, though I am bound
to say that the former preponderated in number, and the houses of the
city were for the most part substantial and well built.&nbsp; Some of
these streets were now crowded with a motley multitude, returning home
from the review, the bright uniforms mixing amongst them as the soldiers
joined their families after being dismissed parade, or here and there
marched in companies back to the barracks.&nbsp; Officers were scampering
down streets on ponies, dragging along the horse boys, who were holding
on by their tails.&nbsp; All this the Mahila Sahib pointed out with
much affability.&nbsp; Had he been the man to seize a good opportunity,
that was the moment to give Jung a push over the low parapet; but the
Mahila Sahib is a man without decision of character; so we all descended,
and he allowed the minister to reach the bottom his own way.&nbsp; We
then proceeded with Jung to his residence, there to partake of a farewell
feast.&nbsp; The carriage in which we were driving was one I had seen
brought over the mountain passes on men&rsquo;s shoulders in detached
portions; and this emanation from Long-Acre was to be trundled for the
rest of its existence along the three or four miles of carriage-road
which the valley of Nepaul can boast.&nbsp; Our way lay through narrow
lanes, walled in by the enclosures of different rich men&rsquo;s suburban
residences, and the prolific orange-trees drooped their luscious fruit
over the garden walls for the benefit of any one who chose to pick them,
as they hung temptingly overhead.&nbsp; Jung showed us his horticultural
arrangements with no little pride.&nbsp; His house is situated in the
midst of gardens, adorned with fountains and reservoirs, and he informed
us that upon one aqueduct alone he had expended 30,000 pounds.&nbsp;
The garden was in its infancy, and, notwithstanding the great formality
with which it was laid out, bid fair to do credit to Jung&rsquo;s taste
and industry.&nbsp; In one direction the gardens extend to the river
side, where he has built some handsome baths, not far distant from which,
and at one corner of his grounds, stands a four-turreted building, inhabited
by the Ranee of Lahore, who has taken refuge from the English under
the hospitable roof of Jung Bahadoor.&nbsp; Here this extraordinary
woman leads a secluded life, rarely venturing outside her doors, and
never giving any one a chance of judging for themselves of her rumoured
beauty.&nbsp; She is, no doubt, meditating some bold design worthy of
the heroism she has proved herself to possess, for she is said still
to retain hope where hope is surely forlorn.</p>
<p>We had not on this occasion walked a whole day over Nepaul roads,
as was the case when last we dined with Jung; consequently, when his
feast was set before us, we did not do justice to it.&nbsp; Perhaps
our appetites were spoiled by the parting which was about to take place,
for we were not to see his Excellency any more, and to part from the
prime minister of Nepaul is not like parting from any other man.&nbsp;
Even were he only a casual acquaintance, it would cause a different
feeling from that of bidding adieu to one who was to lead a peaceable
life, and in all probability die in his bed; but when the chances are
strongly against either of these suppositions, and when the friend whom
you are leaving is a man of so interesting a character, the possessor
of such great talents and of so many amiable qualities, one with whom
you have journeyed and hunted and undergone all sorts of adventures
and witnessed all sorts of scenes, and who has on all occasions proved
himself a kind friend, an hospitable host, and an agreeable companion,
it is anything but pleasant to look upon him for the last time.&nbsp;
Doubtless, in the early years of his yet uncivilized life, Jung Bahadoor
was guilty of great barbarities and crimes, but it was war to the knife,
and self-defence no less than ambition prompted the acts of that bloody
drama.&nbsp; Now he has proved himself a changed man, and his late generous
and humane conduct might well read a useful lesson to many in the civilized
societies in which he learnt to be what he now is, since he does not
fear to change a line of conduct when its error is palpable.</p>
<p>The time at length arrived when we were compelled to bid adieu to
this extraordinary man, whose future career is a matter of such vast
importance to the country he rules with almost absolute power.&nbsp;
Expressing the hope that the day might yet come when I should meet him
in my own country, I took leave of my kind-hearted but perilously-situated
entertainer as I would of a friend in a galloping consumption.</p>
<p>During my whole stay in Nepaul the weather had been unusually foggy,
and the snowy range only displayed its wonders now and then.&nbsp; On
the day following the review the sky was unclouded; I therefore resolved
to ascend the Sheopoori, a mountain which rises to a height of 2000
feet above the valley, and from which it was said a most magnificent
view of the snowy range is obtained.&nbsp; The ascent commenced at a
distance of five miles from the Residency, and was very fatiguing from
the total absence of any path, the steepness of some part of it, and
the thick jungle through which we had to push our way.&nbsp; It occupied
two hours&rsquo; stiff climbing for one in pretty good mountain condition,
but no fatigue seems too great if it is rewarded by a good view; and
there is no prospect so cheering to the mountain traveller as that of
an unclouded sky, with the summit of the hill he is ascending in clear
relief against it.</p>
<p>At last we reached the shoulder, from whence I had a peep that made
me long for more, but, determined not to spoil the effect, I pushed
resolutely on after my guide through a low scrubby jungle, along a barely
perceptible woodcutter&rsquo;s path, until the crisp snow crunching
beneath our feet betokened our great elevation.&nbsp; I was glad to
halt for a moment and cool my mouth with the snow, a luxury I had not
experienced for years.</p>
<p>A few yards more and we gained the summit; a sort of shed, the residence
of some departed holy man, marked the highest point, upwards of 6000
feet above the sea.</p>
<p>A keen sharp wind whistled about the ruin as I jumped on to a half
broken-down wall in order to look over the low bushes which surrounded
me.&nbsp; From this position a panorama, in every respect as magnificent
as it was wonderful, stretched itself, if I may so speak, as well above
as below me.&nbsp; Northward, and not thirty miles distant, the Himalayas
reared their heaven-piercing summits, peak succeeding peak, and crag
succeeding crag, far as the eye could reach, from east to west a glittering
chain, while here and there the light clouds which hung upon its rocks
and precipices became thinned, till they vanished altogether, or, rising
in denser masses from some dark valley, obscured the lower portions
of the range, only to give relief to the summits and elevate them in
appearance&mdash;an aid they little needed, for the height of the lowest
level of the chain is upwards of 15,000 feet.&nbsp; But it was not the
actual height of the various peaks, nor the masses of glistening snow
which clothed them, brightly reflecting the rays of an almost vertical
sun, and tinted by the most brilliant hues, that was the chief cause
of wonder and admiration.&nbsp; It was the sharpness of the horizon-line
against the serene clear sky which displayed precipices and crags of
inconceivable grandeur, the overhanging peak looking down some thousands
of feet upon the lower part of the range.&nbsp; Had it been possible
to calculate upon such a stupendous scale, I felt I was gazing at sheer
precipices 6000 or 8000 feet in depth, for the descent from 25,000 to
15,000 feet was not gradual, but the whole line was cragged and notched
upon a scale of unsurpassable magnificence and grandeur.</p>
<p>The Dawalogiri, the highest mountain in the world, and 28,700 feet
above the level of the sea, was as worthy a termination of the chain
at one end as its rival, the Kinchin Jung, was at the other; while not
ten leagues distant, and completely towering above me, the Gosain Than
reared its gigantic head, the third highest in this mighty barrier.</p>
<p>Turning from this marvellous scene, I looked down upon the placid
valley of Nepaul.&nbsp; Its four rivers appeared like silver threads,
winding their way amidst rich cultivation to swell the waters of the
parent Bhagmutty.&nbsp; Blooming and verdant, the populous plain lay
embosomed in lofty mountains, shut out as it were from the cares of
the world.&nbsp; It seemed a Paradise on earth, with an approach to
heaven of its own along the summit of the Gosain Than.</p>
<p>I viewed with interest a country on which European foot had never
trod, and my eye ranged over bleak hills enclosing fertile valleys,
into which torrents first flung themselves wildly, then, flowing sedately
through to the other end, dashed away again behind rocks and hills and
jumbled masses of broken country, which must have afforded magnificent
scenery as it gradually swelled into the towering mountains of the Emodus.</p>
<p>A distant hill was pointed out to me as that on which the city of
Ghorka was perched, a fitting residence for the wild race to whom it
gives birth.&nbsp; My guide also showed me the road to the mysterious
capital of H&rsquo;Lassa, winding through rocky glens, passable only
for the droves of sheep that traverse those mountain defiles, a journey
of twenty days in the Nepaul dominions; but how far from the frontier
lay the city of the Grand Lama the guide did not know.</p>
<p>The valley of Noyakot is about eighteen miles distant from Katmandu,
and was visited some years ago by Prince Waldemar of Prussia and his
party.&nbsp; It does not offer much attraction to the traveller, and
as I looked into it from the top of Sheopoori I thought it hardly worth
the trip.&nbsp; Not so extensive as that in which Katmandu is situated,
it lies lower and is very fertile.&nbsp; Its climate is much warmer
and not so healthy.&nbsp; Looking up the valley of Nepaul, I could distinguish
at its farther end, twelve miles distant from the present capital, the
ancient Newar city of Bhatgong, the second in importance in the days
when Patn was the first.&nbsp; It has now fallen into much the same
dismantled state as its old rival, while it looked much more picturesque,
standing as it does on a commanding eminence, terraced with rich rice-fields.&nbsp;
The Durbar is a fine old building, characteristic of the architecture
of the country, and the town contains many ancient Newar buildings of
much interest.</p>
<p>But the valley of Nepaul, and the wild mountains of Ghorka, and the
dashing rivers and the rocky glens, all sank into insignificance when
I returned once more irresistibly fascinated by the wonders which the
snowy chain seemed to exhibit anew every moment, as clouds cleared away
from off the frightful precipices, or laid bare huge craggy peaks: For
an hour did I gaze upon this incomparable scene, as upon one which the
experience of a lifetime can seldom boast, for, though I was prepared
by an alpine experience in Europe, and had stretched my imagination
to the utmost in my anticipations of what would be the appearance of
the highest mountains in the world, I could never have conceived&mdash;far
less is it possible for me to describe&mdash;the scene I beheld from
the summit of Sheopoori.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<p><i>A visit to the Minister&rsquo;s brothers&mdash;Dexterity of Colonel
Dhere Shum Shere&mdash;Scenes for lovers of the Fancy&mdash;Adieu to
Nepaul&mdash;The view from the summit of the Chandernagiri pass&mdash;The
scenery of Nepaul&mdash;The pass of Bhimphede&mdash;Night quarters</i>.</p>
<p>It was out of the question my leaving Katmandu without paying a farewell
visit to the Minister&rsquo;s two younger brothers, Juggut and Colonel
Dhere Shum Shere, so I hurried over in the afternoon to their house,
which was situated in the centre of the town.&nbsp; On my road I met
them driving in a buggy, the only one of which the town could boast,
and, as it is not considered <i>infra dig</i>. in Katmandu to go three
in a gig, I jumped in between them, and we were soon tearing along the
narrow street at a most reckless pace, and finally pulled up in a small
square, where a great crowd seemed to be waiting for something to take
place.&nbsp; A Katmandu crowd doubtless possesses the same instinct
in this respect that crowds in civilized parts of the world do, and,
as it proved, they were quite right in their expectations, for the exhibition
which almost immediately followed was well worth seeing.&nbsp; The Colonel
said he had something to show us, but we could perceive nothing out
of the common except a huge bull buffalo, whose head was firmly lashed
to a stake fixed in the court-yard, so that it touched it from his forehead
to his nose; he was then blindfolded, his legs were planted some distance
apart, and he stood snorting at his confined position.&nbsp; Meantime
we had jumped out of the buggy, the young Colonel, stripping himself
of all superfluous clothing, had grasped a &ldquo;korah,&rdquo; or native
sword, and, first laying the keen edge of it gently upon the exposed
neck of the buffalo, he drew himself to his full height, and raised
his korah high above his head.&nbsp; Every muscle extended, every fibre
strained, he seemed to concentrate his strength in a wonderful manner
into that blow which was at one stroke to sever the extended neck of
the buffalo.&nbsp; Down came the sword with sweeping force.&nbsp; I
looked eagerly for the result; when suddenly his hand was arrested midway,
and with a look of vexation the Colonel <i>let off the steam</i> he
had got up for the occasion, as he pointed to one of the buffalo&rsquo;s
legs; it had been moved an inch inwards, and that was sufficient to
cause the failure of the operation.&nbsp; Three or four times did this
occur, and it seemed essentially necessary to the success of the feat
that the legs of the animal should be perfectly stationary in a particular
position.&nbsp; How little was the buffalo aware that each movement
he made prolonged his life some seconds!&nbsp; I could not help thinking
that there was a strong resemblance between his position and that of
Jung, for decidedly the only chance the Minister has of his life is
to keep continually moving.&nbsp; At last down came the korah with crushing
force, and passed right through the animal&rsquo;s neck: the headless
trunk tottered for a second, and then fell heavily over.</p>
<p>I was horrified at seeing a second buffalo brought up for slaughter,
and my horror was greatly increased when I understood that I was expected
to exercise my skill upon it.&nbsp; This offer I declined as politely
as I could, accepting from the young Colonel, as a remembrance of his
dexterity and strength, the korah with which he had performed this extraordinary
feat.</p>
<p>We next adjourned to another court-yard, which was surrounded with
bulldogs and terriers of every description,&mdash;a collection worthy
the most ardent votary of the Fancy.&nbsp; Two magnificent rams, which
were tied up in the corners of the yard, soon after showed us that a
sport existed in Nepaul unknown as yet to &lsquo;Bell&rsquo;s Life.&rsquo;&nbsp;
No sooner were these animals untied than they dashed at one another
with the utmost fury; the violence of the shock caused the combatants
to recoil, and it was a matter of astonishment to us that their brains
were not dashed out.</p>
<p>The whole fight consisted in their being separated and then let go
at one another again.&nbsp; This continued without any apparent advantage
on either side until we thought that they had inflicted punishment enough
on one another for our amusement, and then they were both tied up, and
left to meditate upon their splitting headaches and to scowl at one
another across the yard.</p>
<p>We walked through the Colonel&rsquo;s house, and found in his drawing-room
the usual collection of theatrical prints and portraits of opera-dancers,
mixed up with those of old statesmen, which he seemed to think perfectly
natural, and no doubt he fancies he has good reason for so thinking.&nbsp;
There were also a piano and some European luxuries strangely mingled
with barbarous inventions.</p>
<p>In leaving these two excellent young men, I bade adieu to the last
of my fellow-travellers from Ceylon.&nbsp; My especial favourite of
them all was Colonel Dhere Shum Shere, whose thoroughly frank and amiable
disposition endeared him to every one, while his courage and daring
commanded universal respect.&nbsp; I know of no one I would rather have
by my side in a row than the young Colonel, and his brother Jung evidently
thought so too when he chose him to assist in the capture of the conspirators
in the attempt upon his life.&nbsp; Cheerful and lively, his merry laugh
might be heard in the midst of a knot of his admirers, to whom he was
relating some amusing anecdote, while his shrewd remarks were the result
of keen observation, and proved his intellect to be by no means of a
low order.</p>
<p>His elder brother Juggut was fat, lazy, and good tempered, but wanting
the energy of his brothers.&nbsp; These two are the youngest members
of the family, and are devotedly attached to Jung.</p>
<p>Mounting our ponies at an early hour on the following morning, we
bade adieu to the Residency and its hospitable inmates, and cantered
along narrow lanes bordered by hedges of prickly pear, and roughly paved
with large stones: sometimes we passed between steep banks over gently
swelling hills terraced to their summits, and reminding me strongly
of a vine-growing country.</p>
<p>Soon the road became more broken, and, on gaining the top of a steep
hill, we took our last view of the valley of Katmandu before commencing
the ascent of the precipitous Chandernagiri.&nbsp; From this point we
gazed with indescribable delight on the valley so peculiar if not unrivalled
in its beauty: its compact red-brick villages or straggling houses,
which, with their quaintly-carved gables, clustered up the hillsides;
its sacred groves containing numerous venerated shrines in picturesque
proximity to the clear streams that gushed down from the neighbouring
hills; its ancient cities, whose dismantled walls enclosed the ruined
tenements of a departed race; the richly-cultivated knolls, the Chinese
pagodas, the Bhuddist dagobas on the banks of the sacred Bhagmutty,
the narrow but substantially-built brick bridges by which it was spanned,
continually traversed by an industrious population;&mdash;all these
objects formed a picture, &ldquo;with all the freshness and glory of
a dream,&rdquo; to which the towering monument of Bheem Singh in the
far distance, while it indicated the position of the capital of this
favoured vale, was a fitting centre.</p>
<p>At Thankote, eight miles from Katmandu, we dismounted, and commenced
in earnest the ascent of the Chandernagiri.&nbsp; It is the steepest
pass on either of the roads by which the valley of Nepaul is entered,
and for that reason seems generally chosen by the natives, who would
not for the world miss the pleasure of toiling up an almost inaccessible
mountain.&nbsp; They certainly cannot be accused of neglecting the opportunities
their country affords them for strengthening the muscles of their legs.&nbsp;
The traveller had need to have his shins cased if he intends to climb
a hill with a Newar mountaineer, for the path is so steep that the hillmen,
as they clamber up, frequently dislodge stones, which come tumbling
down upon those behind.&nbsp; However, I should have despised the blows
from the stones, and should not have cared for the fatigue of the rugged
ascent, if, on reaching the summit of the Chandernagiri, I had been
rewarded with the view which it commands in clear weather.</p>
<p>Colonel Kirkpatrick thus describes this glorious scene as it burst
upon him in all its magnificence:&mdash;&ldquo;From hence the eye not
only expatiates on the waving valley of Nepaul, beautifully and thickly
dotted with villages and abundantly checquered with rich fields fertilized
by numerous meandering streams, but also embraces on every side a wide
expanse of charming and diversified country.&nbsp; It is the landscape
in front, however, that most powerfully attracts the attention&mdash;the
scenery in this direction rising to an amphitheatre, and exhibiting
to the delighted view the cities and numberless temples of the valley
below, the stupendous mountain of Sheopoori, the still supertowering
Jib Jibia, clothed to its snow-capped peak with pendulous forests, and
finally the gigantic Himaleh, forming the majestic background to this
wonderful and sublime picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This majestic background was now concealed behind a dense bank of
clouds, and the prospect was bounded by Sheopoori.</p>
<p>The snowy range is the most striking feature in Nepaul scenery, and
the most important element in its composition, since the effect produced
by the grandeur of its stupendous summits is probably unequalled.</p>
<p>It would be hardly fair to compare the valley in which Katmandu is
situated with any other part of the world, since it is so peculiar in
its characteristics and totally unlike the rest of the Nepaul dominions;
but, standing on the summit of Chandernagiri, and looking over the mountainous
district which stretched away to the south, and across which our road
lay, we could not but be struck by the bleak appearance of the mountains,
neither desolate nor rugged enough to possess the majesty of a bold
and sublime solitude, nor sufficiently wooded and populous to exhibit
that softer and more animating character which in the scenery of Switzerland
is no less charming than its grandeur is imposing.&nbsp; Of course this
does not apply to all Nepaul; the lower ranges are more woody, the valleys
more sunny and fertile, but there is a lamentable want of water throughout.&nbsp;
I do not remember ever to have seen so much as a horse-pond in Nepaul,
or a single waterfall of any magnitude: the traveller will therefore
probably be disappointed in the scenery, until he reaches the Chandernagiri,
when indeed he must be difficult to please if he is not fascinated by
the view of the valley at his feet, unsurpassed in the singular character
of its beauty, and of the mountains beyond it, unparalleled by any in
the whole world.</p>
<p>We followed the course of the stream down the mountain and along
the valley of Chitlong, until we reached the foot of the Bhimphede pass,
when, striking into the path by which we had entered Nepaul, we toiled
up it, reaching the summit just before sunset, when we were delighted
by the farewell view of the snowy mountains which we obtained at this
point.&nbsp; The upper edge of the curtain of clouds had now become
slightly lower, allowing a single peak to show itself.&nbsp; Gilded
by the rays of the declining sun, it shone out in strong relief, like
some unusual phenomenon; and as we gazed upon it high in the heavens
we found it difficult to believe that it was part of the earth we stood
on, and felt almost inclined to agree with the faithful, who throughout
India regard this heaven-piercing summit as the centre of the universe,
around which the sun, moon, and stars perform their courses, the sacred
and mysterious Mount Menou.</p>
<p>Gradually the bright crimson rays of the setting sun began to fade,
and reminded us that we had to make a long descent ere we could reach
the tent pitched at the bottom for our reception; and our former experience
had taught us that the Bhimphede pass was not the most pleasant road
in the world on which to be benighted.&nbsp; So we hurried on at the
risk of our necks, the loose stones rolling down before us, and rendering
our footing anything but safe in the growing darkness.</p>
<p>When we reached the foot of the mountain our servants met us with
torches and guided us to the tent; and as we spread our dinner upon
a rickety old bedstead, which, wonderful to relate, this out-of-the-way
village supplied, we came to the conclusion that there were many worse
lodgings in the world than the snug little single-poled tent at the
old Newar village of Bhimphede.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<p><i>A dilemma at Bisoleah&mdash;Ignominious exit from the Nepaul dominions&mdash;The
resources and capabilities of Nepaul&mdash;Articles of import from Thibet
and Chinese Tartary&mdash;A vision of the future</i>.</p>
<p>At Bhimphede we remounted our elephant, following, as before, the
valley of the Rapti to Hetowra, thence through the great saul forest
to Bisoleah, where we expected to find our palanquins.&nbsp; In this
we were not disappointed; but unfortunately our bearers, tired of waiting
for us at so uninteresting a spot, had thought themselves justified
in absconding; which proceeding, while it was a considerable saving
to us in a pecuniary point of view, was particularly annoying under
existing circumstances, the day being far advanced and Segowly still
thirty miles distant.&nbsp; However, by dint of a great deal of threatening,
and coaxing, and bribing, and a very frequent use of the magic name
of the Minister Sahib, who, we assured them, would take into his especial
favour every coolie that volunteered for our service, and would visit
with his heavy displeasure all those who refused, we induced a sufficient
number of men to agree to bear our empty palanquins.&nbsp; Unloading
two ponies, which were carrying cotton, we put our luggage on one, riding
the other by turns, and so, one of us sitting on a rough sack without
bridle or stirrups, the other walking by his side, we marched out of
the village and across the open plain of the Terai.&nbsp; We were soon
after left in darkness, and, becoming separated from our palanquins,
as was to be expected, we lost our way, and wandered for some time disconsolately
over the grassy plain, until at length, stumbling upon a village, we
procured a guide and overtook the bearers a little beyond the Nepaul
frontier.&nbsp; Ere we reached it, however, we were obliged to traverse
numerous streams, which we crossed riding double on our pony.&nbsp;
Altogether we made our exit from Nepaul in very different style from
that in which we had entered it, and were not a little glad to arrive
at Segowly shortly before dawn.</p>
<p>The journey from Katmandu to Segowly can scarcely be accomplished
in less than three days and three nights, not on account of the distance,
but of the frightfully bad roads, which quite preclude the possibility
of travelling faster than at the rate of two miles an hour.</p>
<p>There is scarcely a country in the world in which the state of the
roads is so much to be lamented, since, apart from the benefit which
would accrue to Nepaul itself, we too should be gainers, by having not
only the valuable productions of Nepaul brought to our markets, but
also those of the more distant Thibet, which are always precious from
their intrinsic value, and the cost of which is at present greatly increased
by reason of the expensive journey across the Nepaulese hills in addition
to the transit of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>The Terai is at present the only part of the Nepaul dominions which
is profitable from the revenue yielded by its productions.&nbsp; Valuable
timber and turpentine, ivory and hides, are shipped down the Boori Gundak,
on which river Segowly is situated, to Calcutta; still the cost of a
government licence for cutting timber is so heavy as in a great measure
to deter speculators from engaging in an undertaking in which so considerable
an outlay is demanded, exclusive of the expenses attendant on the felling
and transport of the timber.&nbsp; Besides the saul the Terai contains
ebony, mimosa, and other useful trees.</p>
<p>The trade in hides is not, as I have already remarked, carried out
to the extent it is capable of.&nbsp; But in spite of all these drawbacks,
the Terai alone, of all the Nepaul dominions, can be looked upon by
the British as offering a profitable field for trade and commercial
speculations.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the interior of Nepaul contains productions far more
valuable than those of the Terai.&nbsp; Its mineral resources are such
as would in all probability, if properly developed, render their mountainous,
and in some parts barren country, one of the richest in the world.&nbsp;
Iron, lead, copper, and zinc mines abound, and are in fact worked, but,
from all I could learn, so very badly, that, even did their roads allow
of the export of the metals, it is to be questioned whether, without
the application of a better system, enough metal could be obtained to
do more than supply the home demand.</p>
<p>However that may be, there is no doubt of the existence of these
mines, and, if ever there were tolerable roads, the necessary skill
for working them would doubtless follow.&nbsp; So backward are the Nepaulese
in their treatment of minerals, that they cannot smelt lead: the fact
of their <i>beating</i> cannon-balls into shape proves their incapacity
to cast iron, unless it results from a peculiarity of the ore, so frequent
in India, which, instead of yielding cast-iron at once when reduced
in the usual way, gives wootz&mdash;a condition of iron closely allied
to steel, ductile but not fusible.&nbsp; Of this I had no opportunity
of judging.</p>
<p>Nepaul also possesses mines of sulphur, and, it is said, of antimony;
whether this latter is found in the country does not seem certain; it
is, however, an article of import from Thibet.&nbsp; Amongst other minerals
are corundum, figure-stone, and talc; and amongst the present exports
from the interior of Nepaul may be noticed turmeric, wax, honey, resin,
pepper, cardamums: all these, however, are exported in but small quantities,
owing partly to the difficulty of transport, and partly to the want
of enterprise and capital in a nation thoroughly ignorant of all mercantile
transactions.</p>
<p>It is much to be regretted that no European is now allowed to settle
in Nepaul; for its many latent resources must remain undiscovered, or
at least undeveloped, until the present blind policy of its government
is changed, when British enterprise and British capital introduces a
new era in its commercial existence, which will doubtless prove no less
profitable to the country itself than to the capitalist.</p>
<p>Of the immense expanse of country lying in a north-westerly direction
towards Cashmere we know nothing, save by report, and that is not always
to be trusted.&nbsp; The Minister told me that, in a province three
days&rsquo; journey from the capital in that direction, sufficient horses
were bred to supply the wants of the whole country.&nbsp; That seemed
perfectly possible, considering how limited is the demand in this respect;
but, on our homeward journey, we passed a drove of upwards of two hundred
long-backed, spindle-legged colts, going up to Katmandu, and that did
not seem exactly corroborative of the Minister&rsquo;s assertion.</p>
<p>But, whatever may be its capabilities as regards horses, it doubtless
possesses many resources; but it is not on the productions of Nepaul
alone that the European speculator would calculate, but on the rare
and precious merchandise of Thibet and the northern provinces of China&mdash;such
as the miledo, or exquisitely soft material fabricated from the wool
of the celebrated shawl-goat, itself a rare and valuable animal; and
the chowries or tails of a peculiar species of bullock inhabiting the
snowy regions, at present an article of export from the hill states
in the north-west provinces of India, and extensively used throughout
the continent as fly-flappers.</p>
<p>Musk, procured from the musk-deer, is a most valuable article of
commerce, and the present trade is exceedingly lucrative; of very inconsiderable
bulk, and of great intrinsic worth, it is one of the few things that
can be imported into India with a profit.&nbsp; It there fetches enormous
prices; a small musk necklace, which I saw in the possession of the
Minister, and which certainly was not a foot long, was valued at 25
pounds.&nbsp; It is very seldom, however, that musk can be procured
unadulterated.&nbsp; It is not, however, so much as an ornament, as
a medicine, that we should use this now costly substance.</p>
<p>But the most valuable productions at present imported from Thibet
are mineral.&nbsp; Immense quantities of salt are brought over the Himalayas
on sheep&rsquo;s backs; gold-dust, borax, sulphur, antimony, arsenic,
orpiment, and medicinal drugs are also imported into Nepaul.</p>
<p>The animals which abound in these cold regions, and which might be
worth importing, are musk-deer, sheep, shawl-goats, chowrie bullocks,
falcons, pheasants&mdash;in fact, it would be hopeless to attempt to
enumerate all those productions, animal, vegetable, and mineral, which
are now scarcely known except by name, but which will doubtless some
day be objects of traffic and commercial enterprise.&nbsp; For instance,
there are various medicinal drugs and dyes (among which may be mentioned
madder and spikenard) which are said to exist, but are now almost totally
unknown.</p>
<p>Among the present articles of import are embroideries, taffetas,
chintz, silk, cotton, cloth, carpets, cutlery, sandalwood, tobacco,
conch-shells, soap, etc.&nbsp; Surely it is no very extravagant flight
of imagination to suppose that the day may yet come when the unattainable
and almost unknown productions of the trans-Himalayan regions will be
transported across that mighty range, in well-appointed carriages, over
macadamised mountain-passes; and the noble work of the scientific engineer
will thus supersede the flocks of heavily-laden sheep, driven by uncivilized
and ill-clothed Bootyas, who, &ldquo;impelled by the force of circumstances
over which they have no control,&rdquo; will don their smockfrocks and
turn draymen; when the traveller, going to the coach-office, Durbar-square,
Katmandu, may book himself in the royal mail through to H&rsquo;Lassa,
where, after a short residence at the Grand Lama Hotel, strongly recommended
in Murray&rsquo;s &lsquo;Handbook for the Himalayas,&rsquo; he may wrap
himself in his fur bukkoo, and, taking his seat in a first-class carriage
on the Asiatic Central Railway, whisk away to Pekin, having previously
telegraphed home, <i>vi&acirc;</i> St. Petersburg, that he proposes
returning through North America, and will, therefore, probably be detained
a few hours longer than he had anticipated.</p>
<p>Such a state of things <i>we</i> may not live to see, but it is by
no means unlikely that ere long a railway may run from Calcutta to the
northern frontier of British India; so that, when Nepaul is thrown open
to European enterprise, its costly productions will be easily and cheaply
transported to the nearest port, while the now almost uncivilized Nepaulese
would obtain European luxuries unknown to any of them except Jung Bahadoor
and his travelled suite.</p>
<p>Nor will the idea of a direct communication between Nepaul and Pekin
seem either so improbable or impossible when we consider that an embassy
now makes the journey once every five years.&nbsp; It occupies no less
than two years, including a residence of less than two months in the
capital of the Celestial Empire.&nbsp; I met two or three Nepaulese
who had accomplished the enterprise, and who spoke in glowing terms
of Pekin, and of the magnificence displayed throughout those portions
of the Chinese Empire which they traversed, as well as of the great
city of Lassa, and the terrible mountains to be crossed and the incredible
dangers to be overcome.</p>
<p>The mission is composed of twenty-seven persons, and would not be
admitted across the frontier of China if it consisted of one more or
less than the stated number.&nbsp; It must arrive on the frontier on
a certain day, and is subject to various rules and regulations: at the
same time every provision is made by the Chinese for the comfort of
the members of the embassy while on their journey.&nbsp; The journey
from Pekin to Lassa has lately been made by Messrs. Huc and Gabet, two
French missionaries, and has been graphically described by them.</p>
<p>The Nepaulese look with the greatest awe upon their wealthy and highly-civilized
neighbours; but the Minister, having now lived amongst people more warlike
and accomplished than even the Chinese, regards them with great contempt;
and I should not be surprised if, before long, accounts reach us of
the invasion, by the Nepaulese, of the northern provinces of China,
when the Minister would bring to bear his recently acquired knowledge,
and would doubtless prove more than a match for the rudely-equipped
forces of his Celestial Majesty.</p>
<p>The Tartar race, however, who would oppose the progress of a Nepaul
army, are a very different set from their tea-drinking countrymen on
the southern coast.</p>
<p>But to return from Chinese Tartars to the country we had just quitted.&nbsp;
The kingdom of Nepaul extends for upwards of three hundred miles along
the southern slopes of the Himalayas, and is said to contain a population
of about five millions.&nbsp; Of these four hundred thousand inhabit
the valley of Nepaul proper.&nbsp; The lands are divided into four classes
of tenures&mdash;first, crown lands; secondly, Kroos or Soona Birtha,
belonging to Brahmins or Newars; thirdly, Kohriya or Bari, barren lands
granted for cultivation; and, lastly (and this is the most extensive
class of the four), Kaith, in which the proprietor is at all charges
of tillage, dividing the produce with the cultivator.</p>
<p>The silver coinage of Nepaul is somewhat similar to that in use throughout
British India; in all the northern provinces of which, adjoining Nepaul,
it passes current: the copper coinage is most extensive, and consists
of shapeless lumps of copper, eighteen or twenty of which go to a halfpenny;
they are used by the natives of India in preference to their own pice.</p>
<p>But it is time to take leave of this interesting country, with its
snowy mountains and sunny valleys&mdash;its ignorant people and enlightened
Minister&mdash;its bloodstained past and hopeful future.&nbsp; I had
already mentally whispered my adieu, as, riding behind my companion
on the rawboned pony, I crossed the boundary stream; and pleased and
interested as we had been with our short stay in Nepaul, still we could
not help regretting that it had not fallen to our lot to discover new
wonders&mdash;to encamp on the shores of the great lake situated in
the distant province of Malebum, the existence of which was vaguely
hinted at by my friend Colonel Dhere Shum Shere&mdash;to explore unvisited
mountains, and to luxuriate in the magnificent scenery which they must
contain; the enjoyment heightened by the feeling that we were the first
Europeans who had penetrated their inhospitable recesses.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<p><i>Journey to Lucknow&mdash;Nocturnal disasters&mdash;View of the
Himalayas&mdash;Wild-beast fights&mdash;Banquet given by the King of
Oudh&mdash;Grand display of fireworks&mdash;Our return to cantonments</i>.</p>
<p>Unquestionably the pleasures of travelling cannot be said to be altogether
unalloyed&mdash;a consideration which the journey from Segowly to Lucknow
irresistibly forced upon our minds, how determined soever we might be
to adhere to the traveller&rsquo;s first principle of making the best
of everything.&nbsp; We left the station about dusk, upon a night in
which the elements seemed to have combined to cause us as much discomfort
as possible, and the violence of the storm about midnight compelled
us to take shelter in every tope of trees we came to, or, as it appeared
to me, wherever the bearers thought we stood a good chance of being
struck by the lightning which was vividly flashing in most unpleasant
proximity.&nbsp; The deluge of rain soon made the path so slippery that
our progress was much retarded, which would not have signified had it
not happened that every now and then my slumbers were most disagreeably
disturbed by a crash which flattened my nose against the side of the
palanquin, or produced a violent shock to every part of my body, the
effect of a slip of some unhappy bearer who was himself on the broad
of his back, and had brought down the palanquin, bearers and all, in
his tumble.</p>
<p>This occurred to me no less than five times in one night, and the
consequence was that my palanquin was in even a worse condition than
my body; it did not possess a single uncracked panel, nor were there
any means of keeping the doors in, far less closed, and the cooling
influence of the rain which pelted upon me was only counteracted by
the feverish anxiety I experienced from the momentary expectation of
feeling the bottom give way, which would have inevitably landed me in
the mud in a most deplorable condition&mdash;as had been the case with
every book or other loose article about me.</p>
<p>Daylight, however, revealed a prospect which banished at once the
remembrance of our nocturnal annoyances.&nbsp; The whole of the Himalayan
range, tinged by the glowing rays of the rising sun, displayed to our
delighted and astonished gaze its long and majestic line of snowy peaks,
while the atmosphere, cleared by the night&rsquo;s heavy rain, brought
out in bold relief the sharp outline of every point and angle from the
clear horizon-line of the various summits down to where the light morning
haze still shrouded their base.</p>
<p>Unobscured by intervening mountains, and towering high above a sea
of mist, well may they impress with wonder and admiration the traveller
journeying over the plains of India, as he beholds them for the first
time; nor could I, familiar as they were to me, withdraw my gaze until
the increasing power of the sun rendered the atmosphere more hazy, and
gradually veiled this glorious picture from my view, as if it were too
precious to be exhibited for any length of time.</p>
<p>The journey to Goruckpore occupied us two nights and a day of incessant
travelling over a flat but cheerful-looking wheat country.&nbsp; It
is a pretty little station, containing a regiment and a few civilians,
and is situated on the banks of the Rapti, our old Nepaulese acquaintance
under a very different face.</p>
<p>The Gograh, which we crossed the following morning, is the boundary
that divides the British territory from that of his Majesty of Oudh;
and Fyzabad was the first town in his dominions at which we halted.&nbsp;
Situate about six miles from the river, it is approached by a narrow
muddy lane which winds among numbers of squalid huts, while a considerable
sprinkling of handsome mosques and minarets showed the predominance
of Mahomedanism in the country in which we were now travelling; but
they all seemed falling to decay, and were inhabited chiefly by Hindoo
monkeys, who lazily inspected one another on the sunny corners of some
ruined temple, or chased each other irreverently through the sacred
groves.</p>
<p>Fyzabad was formerly the capital; but the seat of government was
changed to Lucknow at the accession of Azof-up Dowlah in 1775.</p>
<p>We were not sorry, after spending another twenty-four hours in our
rickety palanquins, to see the massive mosques and lofty minarets of
Lucknow looming in the distance, while handsome buildings in varied
styles of architecture gave to this city a handsome and more imposing
appearance than any I had yet visited in the provinces of India.</p>
<p>We had been so much delayed by the weather, that we missed seeing
the wild-beast fight, which was just concluded as we entered the town.&nbsp;
This was not so much to be regretted however, since, from all we heard,
it had on this occasion proved a tame affair, though it is often most
exciting.&nbsp; The fight between the buffalo and tiger seemed to have
caused most interest, but the unfair practice of blunting the horns
of the buffalo was not congenial to the fair-play feelings of the British
portion of the community.&nbsp; Those who have witnessed a combat between
a hy&aelig;na and a donkey, however, say that it exceeds in its ludicrous
interest any other of these animal encounters; the donkey (as is natural)
possesses the sympathies of the spectators, and usually comes off victorious.</p>
<p>His Majesty had prepared a grand entertainment for the evening, whither,
in company with my kind host, the Assistant Resident, I was by no means
sorry to repair&mdash;for the King of Oudh is necessarily associated
in one&rsquo;s mind with exquisite sauces and viands, and we promised
ourselves a first-rate dinner after our tedious journey.</p>
<p>The street leading to the palace was brilliantly illuminated, as
was also the palace itself, while the view from the reception-rooms
was most unique.&nbsp; The glare of lamps lighted up a square, in which
was a garden fitted with the grotesque frames of the various fireworks
of the evening.&nbsp; Birds and beasts of all descriptions were there,
waiting to be let off.&nbsp; Meantime, extraordinary equipages came
driving up in rapid succession; the magnificent coach-and-six of the
King was followed by the unpretending buggy of the bold subaltern, while
natives of high degree descended from gorgeously attired elephants,
or sprang lightly off their prancing Arabs: the varied costumes of the
different guests as they passed under a blaze of lamps added not a little
to the brilliancy and novelty of the scene.</p>
<p>The court-yard behind contained a large tank, in which the reflection
of hundreds of lamps glittered brightly.&nbsp; Servitors, soldiers,
and officers of his <i>Condimental</i> Majesty&rsquo;s household, filled
every available portion of the yard.&nbsp; The spacious reception and
banqueting rooms were crowded to excess, and smelt like a perfumer&rsquo;s
shop in which, by some accident, all the bottles had been left uncorked;
while brilliantly-attired natives scratched past you, glittering with
jewels, and <i>chevaux de frise</i> of sharp gold tinsel.</p>
<p>At last the King made his appearance, and the guests all jostled
into chairs as best they might.&nbsp; My position, almost immediately
opposite his Majesty, afforded me ample opportunity of inspecting the
quantity and quality of the jewels with which his person was absolutely
loaded, and which I had never seen equalled in magnificence: a rope
of pearls, passing over one shoulder, was tied in a knot at his waist,
from which the costly ends negligently depended; his turban and breast
were covered with diamonds and other precious stones; and it was a matter
of wonder that he did not sink under the heat of the room, combined
with the extent of mineral productions he carried on his person.&nbsp;
But the jewels, though worthy of great attention, did not possess nearly
so much interest in my eyes as did the mode by which he renovated the
burly form that they adorned.&nbsp; On one side of him stood the bearer
of his magnificently jewelled hookah, on the other the bearer of the
royal spoon, the contents of which he was already wistfully surveying
as it was mixed up by the skilful feeder into the form and consistency
that his Majesty loved, and put, as a nurse would put pap, into his
Majesty&rsquo;s mouth, which was then carefully wiped by another man,
who, I presume, is called the &ldquo;wiper,&rdquo; and who was succeeded
in his turn of duty by the hookah-bearer, who gently inserted the mouthpiece
between the royal lips, in order that his Majesty might fill up, by
a puff of the fragrant weed, the time required for the preparation of
another spoonful.&nbsp; This routine of feeding, wiping, and smoking
was only varied when the King slowly licked his lips, which he did in
a dignified manner, and with a reproachful look at the wiper, whereat
the wiper might be observed to tremble: poor wiper! I dare say that,
if his Majesty finds it necessary to lick his lips thrice in one meal,
it is equivalent to signing poor wiper&rsquo;s death-warrant.&nbsp;
But his Majesty was not the only person that licked his lips; I found
myself repeatedly doing the same, but it was with the feelings of a
hungry hound as he envies a more fortunate member of the pack the possession
of a juicy bone.&nbsp; Though the royal table groaned with viands, and
though I was famishing, there was nothing but sponge-cake that any but
a madly imprudent person could have ventured on.&nbsp; The cold cutlets,
fried in rancid lard, rise up before me now, an unpleasant vision of
the past; and I distinctly remember the mingled disgust and horror which
I felt while breaking the crust of yellowish tallow to help a gallant
young officer near me, who must have endured the privations of a Sutlej
campaign to enable him to eat it.</p>
<p>At last we discovered some drinkable champagne, and drank her Majesty&rsquo;s
health with all the honours; after which we paid a similar compliment
to his Majesty of Oudh, while all the grandees of the realm&mdash;who,
sitting on chairs like ourselves, lined one side of the long range of
tables, and seemed enveloped in a blaze of glistening jewels&mdash;looked
as if they thought it all a very disrespectful proceeding.</p>
<p>There was a very loud band that played &ldquo;God save the Queen,&rdquo;
and two or three very discordant singing women, who sang what I suppose
was an Ode upon Sauce, as being the Oudh national anthem.&nbsp; At length
dinner was over, and immediately there was a rush to the windows to
see the fireworks, which seemed to be all let off at once, so that it
was impossible to distinguish anything but a universal twisting and
whirling, and fizzing and cracking; and an elephant looked very brilliant
for a moment, and then went off through his eyes with a bang, and was
no more;&mdash;sham men exploded; and real men jumped into sparkling,
crackling flames; and rockets and fire-balloons went up; so that, if
the lessee of Vauxhall or Cremorne could let off or send up half as
many things as were let off and went up on this occasion in the court-yard
of the Lucknow Durbar, he would make a fortune.&nbsp; At last everything
that had not gone in some other direction went out; the King stood at
the top of the stairs, and those who were presented, after receiving
tinsel necklaces from the hands of royalty, passed down stairs, and
the guests went away by whatever means of conveyance they might possess&mdash;a
very motley and somewhat noisy party.&nbsp; The mode which we made use
of to return to cantonments, a distance of four miles, was rather singular,
not to be recommended except on an emergency: the carriages seemed to
have decreased in proportion as the number of guests had multiplied,
and in some unaccountable manner many of us were left to accomplish
our return as best we could.&nbsp; It was in vain that we attempted
to persuade the seven occupants of a buggy to receive us among them&mdash;we
met with a stern refusal.&nbsp; It was useless to supplicate a number
of rich Baboos, on a handsome elephant, to help us in our difficulties;
the rich Baboos laughed, and told us we might get up behind, if we liked.&nbsp;
And so all that brilliant throng went whirling back to cantonments,
and we were left disconsolately standing in the court-yard, with the
probability of having to trudge home.&nbsp; This was not to be thought
of for a moment, and we had just arrived at a pitch of desperation when
a handsome carriage, with the blinds all up, and drawn by a pair of
high-stepping horses, came rattling toward us.&nbsp; Not a moment was
to be lost; we rushed frantically forward and ordered an immediate halt.&nbsp;
In vain did the venerable coachman and determined-looking servant intimate
to us that the carriage was his Majesty&rsquo;s; his Majesty, we assured
them, was still carousing in his palace: so, depositing them both in
the interior, without loss of time we mounted the box, and a moment
after the high-stepping horses were dashing along the road to cantonments
in brilliant style.&nbsp; We looked contemptuously down into the buggy,
still clung to by its seven occupants, and galloped at a startling pace
past the jocose Baboos, very much to the annoyance of their sedate elephant.&nbsp;
On arriving at the cantonments we liberated his Majesty&rsquo;s domestics,
and, ordering them to be careful how they heated his high-caste Arabs
on their way back, we adjourned to a repast, to which the King&rsquo;s
dinner had not incapacitated us from doing ample justice.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<p><i>A Lucknow Derby-day&mdash;Sights of the city&mdash;Grand Trunk
Road to Delhi&mdash;Delhi&mdash;The Coutub&mdash;Agra&mdash;The fort
and Taj&mdash;The ruins of Futtehpore Secreh&mdash;A loquacious cicerone&mdash;A
visit to the fort of Gwalior&mdash;The Mahratta Durbar&mdash;Tiger-shooting
on foot</i>.</p>
<p>On the following morning, in spite of all this dissipation, we, as
well as the greater part of the population of Lucknow, were perfectly
ready to go to the races, which took place at an early hour.&nbsp; After
seeing the first race, which was a well-contested one, and in which
the natives seemed to take particular interest, I went towards the town,
and was amused on the way by comparing the various conveyances used
at Lucknow with those that may be seen on the road to Epsom on the Derby-day.</p>
<p>Here came dashing along a coach and six, the four leading horses
ridden by postilions, while a sporting Baboo drove the wheelers, and
two more sporting friends sat inside, and outriders vociferously cleared
the way.&nbsp; Here two of the King&rsquo;s eunuchs jogged along in
great style on camels with gaudy trappings; after them came prancing
steeds bearing some gorgeously-dressed young princes, and then innumerable
elephants bearing all sorts of disreputable-looking characters, the
gents and blacklegs of the Lucknow community.&nbsp; In fact, I recognised
specimens of nearly all the various classes of society which are to
be met with at races in England, except that none of the fair sex were
to be seen on this occasion.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that Lucknow is a fast place, and contains
a very sporting population; and, if I remember right, the winning horse
was the property of the turbaned owner of a four-in-hand.</p>
<p>As in duty bound, we explored the whole city, but a correct idea
of the edifices with which it abounds is only to be gained from the
drawings, which are executed by the natives with the most delicate minuteness,
and convey a very correct notion of the exterior of the handsome mosques,
minarets, tombs, and palaces, which render Lucknow a most interesting
locality.</p>
<p>The Imaum Bara is said to contain the largest arched room in the
world, a fact which we very much doubted.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Gate of Constantinople&rdquo;
is handsome; not so La Martin&egrave;re, an attempt at an Italian villa,
the figures on the roof of which look as much out of keeping with the
rest of the edifice as the building itself looks out of place planted
in the midst of paddy-fields; it was erected by General Claude Martine,
originally a French grenadier, and it is now, according to his express
intentions, devoted to educational purposes.</p>
<p>One cannot but be struck by the singular taste of eastern potentates,
who are so much more careful to provide a handsome place for their reception
when dead than they are for their residence while alive.&nbsp; Were
I the King of Oudh I should immediately move into the handsome tomb
at present vacant, and leave directions to be buried in my palace.</p>
<p>A night&rsquo;s journey took us to Cawnpore, one of the largest and
most disagreeable-looking stations in India.&nbsp; Here I resumed my
acquaintance with the great trunk road under more favourable circumstances,
and was not a little pleased to find how rapidly I was approaching Delhi.&nbsp;
The carriage in which I travelled was a small palanquin on wheels, which
one horse dragged along with ease; and as the stages were short, and
the road very good, he was generally put into a hand-gallop at starting,
and kept his pace up for the five or six miles allotted to him.</p>
<p>The great number of carts we passed confirmed me in thinking that
this was the proper line for an experimental railway.&nbsp; The country
is here well cultivated throughout; there is no water-carriage to contend
against, and the present means of conveying goods is lamentably slow
and expensive.&nbsp; The formation of the country affords every facility
for the construction of a railway, being perfectly level throughout;
whereas between Calcutta and Benares, the Rajmahal hills have to be
traversed: besides these many advantages, this line would be attended
with a pecuniary saving to the Government, as the two or three military
stations now on this road might be abolished.</p>
<p>The sights at Delhi are worth a visit, but are too well known to
need description.&nbsp; In the centre of the town stands the Jumma Musjid,
the St. Peter&rsquo;s of Mahomedans; its handsome domes and tapering
minarets are built of red sandstone and white marble, a combination
which is common in the edifices of this city, and which produces a most
agreeable effect.&nbsp; From the summit of one of the minarets an extensive
view is obtained.</p>
<p>The large and well-built city, containing 156,000 inhabitants, is
enclosed by a wall, beyond which the country stretches away in appearance
much like the Campagna at Rome.&nbsp; It is covered with ruins, which,
with a few modern tombs scattered amongst prostrate slabs, give it a
picturesque aspect.&nbsp; Through this Campagna we drove one day to
see the Coutub.&nbsp; We passed the handsome tomb of Suftur Jung, and
the mausoleums of many other worthies, the splendour of whose present
resting-places betokened their former greatness.&nbsp; The Coutub is
a tall column that is said to have been originally intended for a minaret,
though the Hindoos claim it as having been erected before the Mahomedan
invasion; however that may be, it is a singularly beautiful monument,
and rises to a height of 260 feet.&nbsp; It was worth toiling up its
narrow circular staircase to enjoy the view which the summit afforded
of the country I had just traversed: the Jumma Musjid at Delhi was discernible
in the distance, while immediately below lay the large camp of the Commander-in-Chief,
the tents of which were pitched with great regularity, and looked dazzling
white in the bright sun.&nbsp; After descending the column, I wandered
awhile amidst the ruins at its foot, some of which looked very much
as if they were of <i>Jain</i> origin,&mdash;and then returned to a
desirable tomb, which the hospitable commissioner has converted into
a delightful retreat from the noisy city.</p>
<p>I left Delhi with no little regret after an agreeable sojourn of
a week, and rolled rapidly over the excellent road to Agra, so smooth
that it was <i>irresistible</i> to the laziest horse, and 130 miles
were easily accomplished in eighteen hours including stoppages.</p>
<p>Of Agra the passing traveller can say little, because its wonders
are so inexhaustible and so interesting.&nbsp; The magnificent tomb
at Secundra of that greatest of Mahomedan princes, Ackbar, must be left
to the description already given by travellers of more leisure; so must
the fort and the white marble palace which it contains, where dwelt
the powerful Aurungzebe when he made Agra his capital.&nbsp; It was
an endless source of interest to me to wander through the paved courts
and under the marble columns of that glistening palace,&mdash;to look
down upon the river, winding at the base of the lofty walls,&mdash;to
descend into dark vaults in which were fountains and baths with water
ever cool,&mdash;to creep yet lower, with a dim flickering light, into
the execution chamber, and stand under the beam which had sustained
the fair form of many a frail and faithless beauty,&mdash;to retreat
from the stifling influence of its confined air, and return to inspect
delicate little mosques, in which the Queen and her maidens used to
perform their devotions, and which were as pure and chaste as the ladies
were supposed to be.</p>
<p>The only other interesting relics in the fort are the renowned gates
of Somnath, which are placed in the arsenal, and which need no description
from my pen.&nbsp; But the greatest sight which Agra affords is the
far-famed Taj Mahal: situated on the banks of the river, it is a conspicuous
object from every quarter, and is as beautiful in its proportions when
seen from a distance as in its details when more closely and minutely
inspected: an unfailing source of gratification to the beholder, it
well merits repeated visits.&nbsp; In its vastness, in its costly material,
in its beautiful proportion, and in its delicacy of detail, it stands
a noble monument of the talent which devised, and of the skill which
executed it.&nbsp; It is said to have incessantly occupied 20,000 men
for 22 years, and three million pounds sterling were expended upon it.</p>
<p>The intention of Shah Jehan, whose ashes it covers, was to have connected
it by a marble bridge with a tomb exactly similar on the opposite side
of the river, in which were to be interred the remains of his wife.&nbsp;
This vast design he never lived to accomplish, and his son, who was
of an economical turn of mind, did not consider the maternal ashes worth
a further expenditure of three millions, and so Shah Jehan and his wife
lie buried in one tomb, which may safely be pronounced the most magnificent
in the world.</p>

<p>I like the Indian system of starting on a journey after dinner.&nbsp;
When other people are going to bed, you get into your comfortable palanquin,
and wake up 30 miles from your companions of the previous evening, who
are only beginning to rub their eyes, when you have already actively
commenced the work of exploring the sights at your destination.&nbsp;
Thus did I inspect the old city of Futtehpore Secreh under the guidance
of Busreet Alee, a garrulous old man, and a perfect specimen of a cicerone,
with whom I at once plunged into the most extensive ruins I had seen
in India: cloisters, colonnades, domes, walls, kiosks, and turrets,
heaped together in the utmost confusion, a mass of red sandstone, except
when some white marble denoted a more sacred or interesting spot as
it glistened in the beams of the rising sun.</p>
<p>Ackbar, the founder of the spacious palaces here situated, was an
exception to the general rule of Eastern potentates, and his residence
must have been even more magnificent than the handsome tomb of Secundra,
in which his ashes repose.&nbsp; The legend regarding the reason for
which Futtehpore Secreh was pitched upon by the monarch as his seat
of government is somewhat singular.&nbsp; It seems that he had long
desired a successor to perpetuate his great name, and rule over his
vast dominions, the possession of most of which he owed to his own strong
arm and fertile genius: it was therefore a great disappointment to him
that the wished-for prince did not make his appearance.&nbsp; Ackbar
accordingly consulted Shah Selim Shurstre upon this important subject,
and Shah Selim Shurstre, who lived at Futtehpore Secreh, recommended
a pilgrimage to Ajmeer, which was no sooner accomplished than Ackbar
became the happy father of Jehan Giri.&nbsp; In gratitude for so eminent
a service, and in order to have the benefit of such sage advice in future
cases of emergency, Ackbar left Delhi, and fixed his residence at Futtehpore
Secreh, which place possessed the further advantage of being more in
the centre of his recent conquests.&nbsp; Notwithstanding his devotion
to the holy man, Ackbar was a most unorthodox Mahomedan, as the figures
of animals carved upon the pillars of the palace plainly testify.&nbsp;
These figures were sadly mutilated by his undutiful grandson, the bigoted
Aurungzebe, who held all such representations in much the same horror
that a Presbyterian would a picture of the Virgin.</p>
<p>Busreet and I went over the ladies&rsquo; apartments, which must
have been very cheerless, since they are entirely composed of immense
slabs of red sandstone and look hard and uncomfortable.&nbsp; Descending
from them to the level of the court-yard, Busreet took me into a narrow
sort of corridor, and jabbered incessantly for some minutes.&nbsp; I
thought I could distinguish the words &ldquo;hide and seek;&rdquo; but
it was so very unnatural to suppose that the only words of English Busreet
knew were &ldquo;hide and seek,&rdquo; that I imagined he was repeating
some Hindostanee phrase, until he dodged round corners and behind pillars,
crying out as he did so, &ldquo;Hide and seek!&nbsp; Hide and seek!&rdquo;&mdash;from
which I at last understood that he meant to inform me that the ladies
used to play that Occidental game in Ackbar&rsquo;s harem; so, after
a short game to show the old man that I understood him, we strolled
on to a singular kiosk-like little building, my guide every now and
then renewing the game and hobbling round corners despite of my remonstrances
to the contrary.&nbsp; The little temple was the residence of the holy
man, and near it a room of most extraordinary construction astonished
me not a little, since I could not divine its use, and Busreet afforded
no information on the subject, as he pulled my head down and whispered
something in my ear, which left me in doubt whether what he told me
was a secret, or whether he meant to intimate that it was a whispering
gallery: its real use I afterwards discovered.</p>
<p>In the centre of a square room was a pillar 15 or 16 feet in height,
the circular top of which was six or eight feet in diameter and had
been surrounded by a stone parapet; communicating with this singular
pulpit-like seat were four narrow stone passages or bridges, one from
each corner of the room.&nbsp; In each corner a minister of the realm
used to sit, only one of whom might approach their royal master at a
time.&nbsp; Seated on this centre point high above the heads of his
subjects, who crowded the room below, and approached only by the four
narrow causeways, the King deemed himself secure from assassination.</p>
<p>It was an original idea, and, after inventing so novel a method for
guarding against treachery, he deserved to die in his bed, as in fact
he did.</p>
<p>Emerging from this singular apartment, we crossed a square, in the
midst of which was placed an immense slab of stone, raised a little
off the ground; on each of the four sides of this slab there were 16
squares marked on the ground like those on a chessboard.</p>
<p>Four ladies used to stand on the squares on each division, making
sixteen in all, each party of four dressed in garments of different
colour from those worn by the others.&nbsp; The King and his ministers
sat on the slab in the middle, and the game, which was something like
chess, commenced.&nbsp; It must have been a glorious game: the prizes
were numerous and worth playing for, and one can easily imagine the
crafty old King moving his Queen so as to take the lovely slave of one
of his ministers, or a handsome and fashionable young noble giving check
to Queen and concubine; probably the Queen could not be taken, but it
must have added immensely to the interest of the game to be playing
with pieces that were interested in the result.</p>
<p>We ascended a handsome gateway of the mosque, 120 feet in height,
whence I looked over a wide expanse of level country, while the intricate
maze of ruins through which we had been wandering lay spread at our
feet like a map; the wall of the city is still entire, and encloses
a space of six miles in circumference, the extent of this once famous
place.</p>
<p>The court-yard of the mosque, which was at least 150 yards square,
contains the white marble tomb of the holy man.&nbsp; It is, without
exception, the most perfect little bijou imaginable.&nbsp; The walls
are composed of immense slabs, or rather screens of marble, delicately
carved and perforated, so that, while they allow a dim light to penetrate,
the effect of the tracery, when viewed from the interior, is exquisite.&nbsp;
While I was admiring this beautiful structure Busreet suddenly assured
me that he was very fond of tea.&nbsp; As he had already made many other
observations equally unconnected with the matter in hand, I merely assured
him of my sympathy; when the more home-question of whether I had any
tea at once enlightened me as to his meaning.&nbsp; I accordingly invited
him to take tea with me, and we sat on the steps of the good man&rsquo;s
tomb, and had a sociable cup together; after which I entered my palanquin,
and, travelling through the heat of the day, returned to Agra in a semi-grilled
condition.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Having seen most of the sights of Agra (and it has a goodly share
of its own), and having made the necessary preparations for the conveyance
to Bombay of our party, now four in number, we took our departure from
the handsome and hospitable residence of the Lieutenant-Governor, on
the evening of the 9th of March, and drove in our buggies by moonlight
over rather a wild country, in rather a wild manner, arriving at the
station, where our palanquins were to meet us, a little before midnight.</p>
<p>An Indian coolie&rsquo;s powers of endurance are marvellous.&nbsp;
Our cort&egrave;ge consisted of 112; and they were to carry ourselves,
servant, baggage, and provisions, at the rate of thirty-five miles a
night, for as many consecutive nights as we should choose to require
their services.</p>
<p>We arrived at Dholpoor next day&mdash;looked down a magnificent well,
about sixty feet in diameter, with corridors round it, and a handsome
flight of stairs leading down to them&mdash;and then pushed on for Gwalior,
crossing the battle-field of Maharajpore, and paying a visit to the
fort perched upon the scarped rock.&nbsp; Some portions of the fort
walls were covered with various devices in green and yellow porcelain,
which added to their singular and characteristic appearance.</p>
<p>We visited the young Rajah in Durbar, and the difference between
the Mahratta and Nepaulese Courts was most striking.&nbsp; The waving
plumes, hussar jackets, and gold-laced pantaloons of the latter were
exchanged for the simple white turban and flowing robe of the Indian
senator; but though the character of their costume may have been more
in accordance with our ideas of Oriental habits, there was a lamentable
deficiency of intellect in their faces, and the fire and intelligence
which flashed from the eye of the Highland noble were wanting in that
of the Mahratta chief.&nbsp; After two days&rsquo; agreeable sojourn
at the Residency we proceeded for two or three consecutive nights over
flat dreary country, spending the days in the miserable little resthouses
provided for the accommodation of the traveller, and generally picking
up a few partridges for breakfast.</p>
<p>At Goonah we had a prospect of more important game.&nbsp; We here
fell in with a most ardent sportsman: the numerous trophies of bears
and tigers with which his bungalow was adorned proved his success as
well as his skill.</p>
<p>With him we sallied forth at about 10 A.M., some on horseback and
some on an elephant, all equally indifferent to the sun, fiercely blazing
in an unclouded sky, and reached a dell, the sides of which were covered
with a low scrubby jungle, where sport was to be expected.</p>
<p>As tiger-shooting on foot is almost unheard of in the northern part
of India, and is practised in the southern only, because the tiger there
is a much less formidable animal than his majesty of Bengal, we were
told to proceed with considerable caution by the veteran, who posted
us in the most likely places, saying to one of our party, as he stationed
him in the most <i>favourable</i> locality, &ldquo;I put you here because
the tiger is nearly sure to charge down this hill; and if he does, there
will be very little chance of escape for you, as you see he has so much
the advantage of you, that if you do not kill him with either barrel&mdash;and
the skull of a tiger is so narrow that it is exceedingly improbable
you will be able to do so&mdash;he must kill you, but I would not for
the world that you should miss the sport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus did this self-denying Nimrod debar himself the pleasure of being
charged by a tiger, reserving it, in the kindest manner, for his guests,
who but half appreciated the sacrifice he was making on their account,
from their dread of themselves becoming a sacrifice to the tiger.&nbsp;
And as they crouched behind their respective bushes they had time to
brood over the appalling stories of hairbreadth escapes just recounted
to them by the gallant captain, who had been particular in describing
the requisites for the successful tiger-shot&mdash;the steady hand and
steady nerve&mdash;admitting that these were not always efficacious,
as the last tiger he had encountered had struck him on the leg, and
his torn inexpressibles existed to this day to testify to it.&nbsp;
The thoughts of this and sundry other escapes he had experienced made
the blood run cold, as one imagined every rustle of the leaves to be
a bristling tiger, preparing for his fatal spring.</p>
<p>Gradually the beaters approached nearer and nearer, and, as the circle
became smaller, pea-fowl innumerable flew over our heads with a loud
whirr, their brilliant plumage glancing in the sunshine like shot-silk.&nbsp;
A few moments more, and I perceived stripes gliding rapidly behind a
bush, and a shot from L--- made me suspect that our <i>worst</i> anticipations
had been realised, and that we had really found a tiger&mdash;a suspicion
which soon disappeared, however, as a grisly hy&aelig;na bounded away,
having received a ball in his hind-quarters, which unfortunately did
not prevent his retreat.</p>
<p>The beaters soon after appeared over the brow of the hill, and relieved
us for the present from further apprehension of that charge which was
to seal our fate, for the monarch of the Indian jungle had changed his
location.&nbsp; We beat some more jungles, in the hope of finding other
game, but only succeeded in bagging a deer.&nbsp; I had a long shot
at a four-horned buck, but the smooth bore of my piece was not equal
to the distance.</p>
<p>On our way home we came upon a cave, which, from marks in the neighbourhood,
bore evident signs of containing a panther; we accordingly attempted
to smoke him out by lighting quantities of straw at the mouth, but he
was not to be forced out of his secure retreat, and preferred bearing
an amount of smoke that would have stifled a German student.</p>
<p>On the following day we renewed our attempt to find a tiger, and
were to a certain extent successful, as at one time we were within a
few yards of him, and could see the bushes move, but he succeeded in
breaking through the line of beaters; and some deer and a neelgye were
all the game we could boast of, notwithstanding a perseverance and endurance
of heat worthy of greater success.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<p><i>The carnival at Indore&mdash;Extraordinary scene in the palace
of the Holkar&mdash;A night at the caves of Ajunta&mdash;The caves of
Ellora and fortress of Doulatabad&mdash;The merits of a palkee&mdash;Reflections
on the journey from Agra to Bombay&mdash;Adieu to India</i>.</p>
<p>After a few days&rsquo; more travelling over the hot dry plains of
Malwa we reached its capital, Indore, where we spent some days at the
hospitable mansion of the Resident, and paid a visit to the Rajah, whose
palace is situated in the centre of that large and populous town.&nbsp;
During our visit a most extraordinary scene occurred.&nbsp; It happened
that a sort of carnival was going on; but the bonbons and bouquets of
Italy are here represented by little balls containing red, purple, or
yellow dust, which burst the moment they strike the object at which
they are thrown, and very soon after the <i>row</i> commences two-thirds
of the population are so covered with red dust that they present the
most extraordinary appearance; but it is not the dust-balls which contribute
so much to the dyeing of the population as the squirts full of similar
coloured liquids, which are to be seen playing in every direction.&nbsp;
Woe to the luckless individual who incautiously exhibits himself in
the streets of Indore during the &ldquo;Hoolie;&rdquo; not that we ran
any risk upon the occasion of our visit to the Rajah, as we were on
that account tabooed, and could laugh at our ease at the rest of the
claret-coloured world.&nbsp; Here a woman passed spotted like a coach-dog:
she had just come in for a spent discharge, and had escaped the deluge,
which her puce-coloured little boy had received so fully that his whole
face and person seemed to partake of the prevailing tint; while yonder
old greybeard is dusting his moustache from the red powder which tinges
it in strong contrast to the rest of his sallow countenance.</p>
<p>After going through the ceremony of squatting on the floor of the
Durbar&mdash;our seven pair of unruly legs all converging to a common
centre, from our inability to double them under us, as his Majesty did&mdash;we
adjourned to the hall below to witness the &ldquo;Hoolie&rdquo; in safety.&nbsp;
On each side of the court-yard was a sort of garden-engine, one filled
with a purple and the other with a light-red fluid.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s
body-guard were now marched in and divided into two parties, each sitting
under one of the garden-engines.&nbsp; At the main gateway of the court-yard
stood two elephants, with tubs of coloured liquid before them.&nbsp;
At a given signal the gallant troops were exposed to a most murderous
cross-fire, which they were not allowed to return: both garden-engines
began playing upon them furiously, and the elephants, filling their
trunks, sent the contents far and wide over the victims, who crouched
down and bore in patience the blood-red storm.&nbsp; At the same moment
that a dexterously-applied squirt whisked off some individual&rsquo;s
turban, a fountain from the other side playing into his eyes and mouth
prevented him from recovering it until some more fortunate neighbour,
suffering perhaps from ear-ache, received the claret-coloured salvo
with such violence that, if it failed to drive away the pain altogether,
it must have rendered him a martyr to that complaint for the rest of
his life.</p>
<p>After getting a thorough soaking they were sprinkled all over with
a fine red powder, which, caking upon them, completed the ceremony by
rendering them the most muddy, sticky-looking objects imaginable, as
they withdrew from the presence of the young Rajah, after receiving
pawn.</p>
<p>We were now offered balls of powder: had we thrown one at his Majesty,
which some of his household seemed very anxious we should do, nothing
could have saved us from a deluge.&nbsp; To commence the game upon the
royal platform is the signal of indiscriminate warfare throughout the
whole palace; the now passive troops would then have been allowed to
retaliate, the garden-engines would have been stormed and captured by
opposing squadrons, and the battle would have raged furiously until
dark whereas now, company of soldiers after company were ordered in
to be shot down like sheep.&nbsp; We, however, were contented with seeing
each party come in white and go out red, without wishing to go out red
ourselves; besides which, we should have been outnumbered, and Britons,
for the first time, would have been obliged to beat a retreat with tarnished
honour as well as tarnished jackets.</p>
<p>The usual ceremony of presenting scents, spices, and garlands, having
terminated, we left the young King, much pleased with his intelligence
and good-nature: though only seventeen, he is a stranger to those vices
which are generally inherent in natives, and inseparable from their
courts.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>We were ten days on our journey to the caves of Ajunta, having spent
two or three at the hill fort of Aseerghur, a characteristic Mahratta
stronghold; it is perched 700 feet above the plain, and just capacious
enough to contain a regiment, who must find some difficulty in climbing
its rocky steep approach, up which, however, the ponies of the garrison
scramble nimbly enough.</p>
<p>We galloped over one afternoon from Furdapore to the caves of Ajunta,
and were delighted with their romantic situation high up the rocky glen
terminating in a waterfall, and so narrow, gloomy, and silent that it
harmonized well with these mysterious caverns, in one of which, more
free than the rest from bats, we determined to pass the night; and here,
surrounded by staring Bhuddas and rampant elephants, and gods and goddesses
making vehement love, according to the custom of such gentry, we had
a most comfortable tea preparatory to turning in: spreading my blanket
under the nose of a huge seated figure of Bhood, and guarded by two
very tall individuals in faded painting, which, as they had watched
over Bhood for twenty centuries, must have been well competent to perform
the same kind office for me, I was soon comfortably asleep, my head
pillowed on a prostrate little goddess, whom I was very reluctant to
leave when daylight warned us to proceed upon the work of examining
the wonders of the Rock Temples of Ajunta.</p>
<p>So much has already been written on the interesting subject of the
caves of Ajunta, that they are more or less familiar to every one, or,
if not already familiar, are destined soon to become so, thanks to the
skill and energy of Captain Gill, who is at present engaged in making
copies of all the paintings.&nbsp; These will form a splendid collection,
and some of them have already been sent to England, and placed in the
collection at the East India House.&nbsp; It was doubly delightful to
us, who had just previously examined the originals, to look over the
portfolios of this talented draftsman.</p>
<p>Ere we left the village of Ajunta we visited its neat whitewashed
mosque: the association connected with it must be replete with interest
to the Englishman, when he calls to mind that in it the Duke of Wellington&mdash;then
Sir Arthur Wellesley&mdash;wrote his despatches immediately previous
and subsequent to the victory of Assaye.</p>
<p>The caves of Ellora are two days&rsquo; journey from those of Ajunta,
and are much more cheerfully situated on the face of a hill commanding
an extensive view over a more smiling country than is usually to be
met with in the Deccan.</p>
<p>It is difficult to say which set of caves are most worth seeing;
differing in many respects, they may be said to afford equal attraction
to the traveller.&nbsp; Ellora can boast of the wonderful &ldquo;Kylas;&rdquo;
Ajunta of those most interesting frescoes which carry the art of painting
back to an unknown period, but which at Ellora have been almost totally
obliterated by the ruthless and fanatical zeal of Aurungzebe.</p>
<p>A few miles from the caves of Ellora frowns the rock fortress of
Doulatabad, a conspicuous object from every side, and we soon discovered
its interior to be as singularly interesting as its exterior was formidable
and imposing.&nbsp; The rock itself is a pyramid rising abruptly to
a height of 700 feet above the village which nestles at its base, while
it is scarped all round to the broad moat by which it is encircled,
forming a sheer precipice of 100 or 150 feet in depth.</p>
<p>Passing through a massive gateway which led into the town, we entered
the fort by a similar approach, and crossing the moat by a narrow bridge
we plunged into a dark hole directly opposite; then passing by torchlight
through some small caves which were entered by very low portals, we
began to ascend the inclined plane which wound up the interior of the
rock, and which gradually became steeper till it ended in a flight of
steps, our guides lighting us on our uncertain path, until we emerged
into daylight by a large iron trap-door, pierced with innumerable small
holes, the object of which, as well as of a groove in the rock communicating
with the subterranean passage, was to enable the garrison, by filling
the passage with smoke and flame, to suffocate and blind the besiegers
should they ever succeed by any accident in penetrating thus far&mdash;in
itself, as it seemed to me, a very improbable contingency.&nbsp; We
clambered up the face of the rock to its summit, whence we had an extensive
view of the arid plains of the Deccan.</p>
<p>Arungabad is the first station which we had visited in the dominions
of the Nizam.&nbsp; We were now approaching the confines of civilization,
and it became necessary to part with our palkees and the bearers, who
had accompanied us from Agra.&nbsp; A separation from the latter was
easily borne, and they, on their part, were no doubt glad to get rid
of the burdens they had been carrying for the last month.&nbsp; But
to bid adieu for ever to one&rsquo;s palkee is a severe trial; and no
wonder, for to a man not in a hurry it is the most luxurious and independent
means of travelling conceivable.</p>
<p>If judiciously arranged it contains everything the traveller can
want&mdash;a library, a cellar, a soda-water range, a wardrobe, a kitchen;
in fact, there is no limit to the elasticity of a palkee.&nbsp; My plan
was, surreptitiously, to add a new comfort every day, and the unsuspecting
coolies carried me along as briskly as if my palkee contained nothing
but myself, and never seemed to feel the additional weight, upon the
principle of the man who could lift an ox by dint of doing so every
morning from the time when it was a calf.</p>
<p>Then the delightful feeling of security, and the certainty that your
bearers won&rsquo;t shy, or come into collision, or go off the rails,
or otherwise injure your nerves or bones.&nbsp; You are independent
of hotels and hospitality.&nbsp; If the traveller in India depended
upon the former, he would pass many a night with the kerbstone for his
pillow, if he had not courage to claim the latter&mdash;which, be it
remembered, he is certain to receive abundantly at the hands of the
Burra Sahib.&nbsp; A modest man has his palkee; and for lack of courage
on the one hand, and a rest-house on the other, he orders himself to
be set down for the night by the wayside, and, shutting the doors towards
the road, after boiling the water and making tea with the apparatus
contained in his pantry, he lights his lamp, reads for an hour, pulls
a light shawl over him, turns round, and goes to sleep as soundly as
if he were sumptuously couched in Belgravia.</p>
<p>If the palkee be a good one, it defies weather; but I admit it is
not pleasant, on a dark night, to be carried along a slippery road with
a careless set of bearers.</p>
<p>During the whole period of our journey since we had left Agra, with
one or two breaks in its ordinary routine, we seemed to have been passing
a monotonous existence at the same small and uncomfortable bungalow.&nbsp;
It consists of two rooms; in front is a tope of trees; behind are a
few low sandstone or trap hills, some scrubby bushes climbing up the
sides, out of which a partridge may easily be flushed: for the rest,
the view extends over a boundless plain, assuming during the heat of
the day a light yellow colour, at which period the coolies are all asleep
in the verandah, snoring in an infinite and interesting variety of notes
and keys.</p>
<p>At sunset we take a constitutional, followed by our portable residences,
into which, after a romantic tea-drinking by the roadside, we turn in
for the night, awaking at daylight to find ourselves thirty miles nearer
to our journey&rsquo;s end, in a bungalow precisely similar to the one
we had lately quitted, and containing the same rickety table, greasy
with the unwiped remains of the last traveller&rsquo;s meal, which the
book will inform you was eaten a month ago&mdash;the same treacherous
chairs, which look sound until you inadvertently sit upon them&mdash;the
same doubtful-looking couch, from which the same interesting round little
specimens emerge, much to the discomfort of the occupant&mdash;the same
filthy bathroom, which it is evident the traveller a month ago did not
use&mdash;the identical old kitmutgar or bungalow-keeper, who looks
as uncivilized as the bungalow itself, and seems to partake of its rickety
and dirty nature&mdash;the same clump of trees before, and the same
desert plain behind;&mdash;all tend to induce the belief either that
you have never left the bungalow in which you spent the previous day,
or that some evil genius has transported the said bungalow thirty miles
for the express purpose of persecuting you with its horrors and miserable
accommodation.</p>
<p>Thus are 700 miles insensibly accomplished in a month by the traveller,
who only passes a dreamy existence in dak bungalows, to be roused into
violent action on his arrival at some sporting vicinity, a large cantonment,
a native Court, rock temples, or other excitements, which must occur
in the experiences of the Indian traveller.</p>
<p>I went seventy miles in a bullock hackery, the most unpleasant mode
of travelling I conceive that can exist; then one hundred miles in a
rickety pha&euml;ton with a pair of horses, which was in a slight degree
less intolerable; and after visiting Mahabuleshwa, the hill station
of Bombay, I reached that mercantile emporium itself, not a little pleased
at seeing the sea on the English side of India.&nbsp; I was disappointed
with the far-famed Bay; but perhaps it is difficult to do justice to
scenery after so much wandering, when the most interesting view is the
sight of home.&nbsp; Certainly one&rsquo;s impressions of a place are
regulated in a great degree by the circumstances under which it is visited.&nbsp;
Had Bombay been the port of debarkation instead of embarkation, the
bay would have been lovely and the various points of view enchanting;
as it was, the prettiest object to my perverted vision was the &ldquo;Malta&rdquo;
getting up her steam to paddle me away from that land, whose marble
tombs&rsquo; and rock-cut temples will continue to afford attractions
to the traveller when its Princes no longer exist sumptuously to entertain
them, and whose towering mountains will still disclose fresh wonders
when that last independent state which now extends along their base
shall have been absorbed into one vast empire.</p>

The arms of his body-guard were bought in London, of Purdy, Lancaster,
and other eminent rifle-makers, and cost Jung about 2000 pounds.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
